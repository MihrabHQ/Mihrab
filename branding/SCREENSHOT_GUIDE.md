# App Store screenshot guide — Mihrab

The app store wants 6.9″ (iPhone 16/17 Pro Max) and optionally 6.5″ shots. The iPhone 17 Pro Max simulator is already booted — every Cmd+S inside the simulator window saves a PNG to your desktop at the device's native resolution (1320×2868), which is exactly what App Store Connect expects for the 6.9″ slot.

You only need 3 screenshots minimum and can submit up to 10 per device class. I'd ship six — they tell a complete story without being filler.

## Before you shoot

In the simulator, go to the OS-level **Settings** app first and set:

- **Display & Brightness → Light** (most of the shots) — Apple's listing reviewers prefer light mode for hero screenshots; it reads cleaner against their store template.
- **General → Language & Region → English** for the first language pass; we'll do an Arabic pass after.
- **Status bar**: open the simulator menu **Features → Toggle In-Call Status Bar** isn't needed, but **Device → Erase All Content and Settings** before the first shot gives you a clean status bar with full battery and full signal.
- The status-bar override (clean 9:41 / full battery / no notch icons) comes from `xcrun simctl status_bar … override --time '9:41' --batteryLevel 100 --batteryState charged --cellularBars 4 --wifiBars 3` — run that once before the screenshot session.

In Mihrab itself, complete the onboarding (location: pick "Sweden — Stockholm" or your real city) so every shot has real prayer times to display.

## The six shots

### 1 — Home, next prayer hero (light, English)

Mihrab's strongest screen: 64pt tabular time, three-letter prayer name above it, a calm rounded card. The launcher icon's deep teal is reflected in the accent.

- Open the app fresh.
- Make sure the home tab title says **Mihrab**, the location pin and Settings gear are in the header.
- Frame: title bar visible, NextPrayerCard centred, the day's prayer carousel just peeking under it.
- Cmd+S in the simulator.

### 2 — Quran reader (dark, English with translation)

Mushaf-style Arabic Uthmani text alongside the chosen translation reads beautifully in dark mode and shows off the typography work.

- iOS Settings → Light to **Dark**.
- In Mihrab → Quran tab → Surah Al-Mulk (#67). It's mid-length, recognisable, and the screen will show ~3 ayahs of Arabic + English.
- Make sure the translation toggle shows **Sahih International** (or Tafsir al-Muyassar if you want to highlight the Arabic exegesis).
- Frame: surah header (الملك / Al-Mulk / 30 ayahs · Meccan) at top, two ayah cards visible.
- Cmd+S.

### 3 — Dua library — Ayat al-Kursi (light, English)

The category chips along the top with the Arabic, transliteration, translation and source attribution show off the i18n + Arabic typography.

- Switch back to Light mode.
- Mihrab → Duas → **Morning** category → scroll to **Ayat al-Kursi** at the top.
- Frame: the category chip row + the full Ayat al-Kursi card (Arabic, transliteration, translation, source line).
- Cmd+S.

### 4 — Tasbih counter (dark, Arabic)

The tasbih screen is visually quiet — the big tabular 33-count number in the centre, the Arabic dhikr above it. Switching the simulator's language to Arabic for this single shot shows off the RTL polish.

- iOS Settings → General → Language → Arabic (or Mihrab → Settings → Language → Arabic if you don't want to flip the OS).
- Switch to dark mode if not already.
- Mihrab → Tasbih → **Subhanallah**. Tap the counter ~5 times so the screenshot shows "5 / 33" rather than "0 / 33" — proves it's interactive.
- Frame: Arabic dhikr at top, big "5 / 33" centred, Prev/Reset/Next row at bottom in Arabic.
- Cmd+S.

### 5 — Fasting tracker — upcoming Sunnahs (light, Arabic)

Demonstrates the Hijri awareness and the fasting/journal feature set. Looks particularly compelling in Arabic.

- Keep Arabic locale, switch back to Light mode.
- Mihrab → Fasting tab.
- Frame: TODAY hero card at top (showing "لم يُسجَّل صيام اليوم." / "سجّل صيام اليوم"), the three stat tiles, the upcoming-Sunnahs list (يوم عرفة, الأيام البيض, يوم عاشوراء visible).
- Cmd+S.

### 6 — Qibla compass (dark, English)

A wide hero shot with the dial, accent-tinted needle, and the bearing in degrees. Final shot in the carousel; closes strong.

- iOS Settings → Language → English, dark mode.
- Mihrab → Compass tile in QuickActionsGrid.
- Hold the device steady so the needle points at the Ka'bah; if the simulator can't simulate the magnetometer, drag the simulator itself to a stable position and the visual reads cleanly anyway.
- Frame: the full compass dial centred, the bearing readout below.
- Cmd+S.

## Optional 7th — widget preview

If you have time, the home-screen widget on iOS is a strong differentiator. Pin the medium widget to the simulator's home screen (long-press → + → Mihrab → medium → Done), then Cmd+S the home screen with the widget visible. Recommend this only if you have one screenshot slot left over — Apple shows the first 3 in the search results and the rest in the listing.

## Theme rotation summary

| # | Screen | Mode | Locale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Home — next prayer | Light | English |
| 2 | Quran reader | Dark | English |
| 3 | Dua — Ayat al-Kursi | Light | English |
| 4 | Tasbih counter | Dark | Arabic |
| 5 | Fasting — upcoming | Light | Arabic |
| 6 | Qibla compass | Dark | English |

Three light / three dark; four English / two Arabic. Shows the i18n surface without making half the carousel inaccessible to non-Arabic readers.

## After Cmd+S

Each screenshot lands on your **Desktop** as `Simulator Screenshot - iPhone 17 Pro Max - …png` at 1320×2868. Drag them straight into App Store Connect → My Apps → Mihrab → 1.0 (or the in-prep version) → Screenshots → 6.9-inch iPhone.

An app that ships an iPad build needs its own iPad pass: App Store Connect will not accept iPhone screenshots for the iPad slots. See "The store sets" below for the sizes and the folders they live in.

Localised App Store listings (Arabic, Swedish, French, etc.) can reuse the same screenshots — App Store Connect doesn't require localised images for each language.

## Where the simulator saves screenshots

By default `~/Desktop/Simulator Screenshot - <device> - <date>.png`. If your desktop is busy, change it via simulator menu **File → Save Screen As…** and pick a folder.

## The 2.28 set (2026-10-02) — READ THIS ONE FIRST

The store story now follows `branding/IDENTITY.md`: the companion, not a
prayer-times app. Every panel carries the descriptor under the wordmark
("Mihrab · The Muslim Companion"), and the first headline is the
identity's own headline. Eight panels per phone set, in pillar order:

| # | Android phone | iPhone 6.9″ / iPad 13″ | Pillar |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Today | Today | Pray — "For every prayer, and everything between" |
| 2 | Mushaf, tajweed colour, recited word lit | same | Read and listen |
| 3 | Tilawah, playing | same | Read and listen |
| 4 | Āyah sheet, Tajweed tab | same | Read and listen |
| 5 | Duas — Āyat al-Kursī opened | same | Remember |
| 6 | Tasbih, part-way | same | Remember |
| 7 | Log | same | Yours |
| 8 | Qibla | Month (no magnetometer in a simulator) | Pray |

The Android tablet has six: Today, the spread, Tilawah, duas, log, month.

Captions live in `CAPTIONS` in `build_store.py`; one headline size per set
(`headline_size`), balanced wrapping (no orphan word), and a landscape-only
line break where the tablet's text column needs one (`LANDSCAPE_HEADLINES`).
F-Droid file names are now SLOTS (`FDROID_SLOTS`): the panel in position n
overwrites whatever file F-Droid already holds at n, so reordering the story
never leaves a stale screenshot on the listing.

How this set was shot, for next time: Android on `Mihrab_API_37` with the
beta build (`assembleGithubBeta`, installs beside nothing), clock pinned
with `adb shell date 100209412026.00` and the zone set to
`Africa/Casablanca`; the tablet by `wm size 2560x1600` + `wm density 280`
on the same emulator. iOS on a fresh install per simulator, onboarding
run through, the muṣḥaf fonts copied across from a simulator that had
them (`Documents/quran`), the app launched with
`SIMCTL_CHILD_TZ=Africa/Casablanca` so its times are Casablanca's, and the
status bar pinned to the same zone's clock. One emulator or simulator at a
time, shut down before the next one boots.

Not yet handled: an iPad in iPadOS 26 draws a resize grabber in the
bottom-right corner, and the simulator offers no way to turn windowing off.

---

## The 2.18 set (2026-09-09) — superseded by 2.28

The current set. `branding/screenshots-2.18/` holds the raw captures every
piece of imagery is built from, and three commands turn them into
everything:

```sh
python3 branding/tools/build_store.py    # the four store sets + Play's two assets
python3 branding/tools/build_shots.py    # the site gallery, the README grid, the cache stamp
node scripts/build-site.js               # rewrite the thirteen language pages
python3 branding/tools/verify_store.py   # must print ALL STORE ASSETS PASS
```

Then the hero and the Play feature graphic, which come from `compose_wide`:

```sh
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'branding/tools'); from compose_wide import hero, feature_graphic; S='branding/screenshots-2.18/'; hero('branding/github-hero.png', S+'ios-home.png', S+'ios-mushaf.png', S+'ios-duas.png'); feature_graphic('branding/play-feature-graphic.png', S+'ios-home.png')"
cp branding/github-hero.png docs/assets/img/og-hero.png
```

### What the app has to be set up as

Casablanca on automatic (so the chip reads a city and not a pair of
coordinates — the manual search stores the result's full label, which
truncates to "Casablanca, Pachalik…", while automatic reverse-geocodes to
"Casablanca Auto"), the 24-hour clock, notifications granted so the rows
carry bells rather than crossed-out ones, three prayers logged, the
practice graph filled from the Log's own "Fill the past three months",
a fast marked, the tasbih part-way through a set, and the muṣḥaf
downloaded. The Mālikī rows are OFF for the home shots and ON for the
one figure that is about them (`and-home-maliki`).

### What each capture is for

Everything comes from ONE Android phone set plus one capture each from the
tablet, the iPhone and the iPad. The site's phone figures, the README grid
and the Play/F-Droid phone set are all the same seventeen Android files —
which is the point: the page used to carry a handful of images no script
knew about (fasting, memorising, the reciters, Tilāwah, the Android
widgets) and they went a release and a half stale beside the ones next to
them. `shotParity.test.ts` now holds the README and the site
byte-identical, and `build_shots.py`'s two lists are the whole of it.

### Capturing on Android, headless

The phone emulator (`Mihrab_API_37`) is rootable, which is what makes the
clock settable — and the clock is what the sky is drawn from, so it is not
a detail. The tablet AVD is a Play image and is NOT rootable, so its clock
cannot be set at all: capture the tablet set by resizing the PHONE
emulator instead, which also spares you a second setup and a second
180 MB muṣḥaf download.

```sh
export ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554
adb root; adb shell settings put global auto_time 0
adb shell date 0909094126                      # 09:41, to match the demo clock
adb shell wm size 1080x2400; adb shell wm density 420    # the phone set
adb shell wm size 2560x1600; adb shell wm density 320    # the tablet set
adb shell settings put system time_12_24 24
adb shell cmd appops set com.prayer_times SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM allow
adb emu geo fix -7.6200 33.5945                # longitude first
adb shell cmd uimode night yes|no              # the dark figures
```

Demo mode drifts if you broadcast it twice — a second `network … wifi
show` adds a second wifi glyph to the status bar. Send `exit` first, then
`enter` and the five commands once each, before every capture.

### Capturing on iOS, headless

`idb ui tap` does nothing at all until a companion is connected for that
UDID, and it fails silently rather than erroring:

```sh
idb_companion --udid <iphone-udid> &                  # default port 10882
idb_companion --udid <ipad-udid> --grpc-port 10884 &
idb connect localhost 10882; idb connect localhost 10884
idb ui describe-all --udid <udid>   # frames are POINTS, and are CONTENT
                                    # coordinates in a scroll view — a row
                                    # at y=1039 on a 1376pt screen is off
                                    # the bottom and cannot be tapped
xcrun simctl privacy <udid> grant location-always com.hassan.prayerapp
xcrun simctl location <udid> set 33.5945,-7.6200
xcrun simctl status_bar <udid> override --time '9:41' --batteryLevel 100 \
  --batteryState charged --cellularBars 4 --wifiBars 3
```

Three things a simulator cannot do, and what was done instead:

- **The clock is the host's.** There is no way to set a simulator's time,
  so the iOS and iPad sets were shot in the evening and show the night
  sky with the moon. That is honest and rather good, but it does mean the
  Apple sets and the Android sets are different times of day.
- **No magnetometer**, so the Qibla dial reads "Live compass unavailable".
  The iPhone set therefore has SIX panels and no qibla; the Android sets
  keep theirs, because the emulator's sensors answer.
- **WidgetKit timelines do not populate.** A widget added to a simulator
  home screen stays on "Open Mihrab" however often the app is opened, so
  `ios-widgets.png` is still the real-device capture from the 2.14 pass —
  the one image in the set that is not from this build. The Android
  widgets figure IS current, and it is the one that matters: the Sky
  widget is Android-only.

Adding a widget on the simulator, for when that changes: long-press the
home screen (`idb ui tap --duration 2.0`), **Edit → Add Widget**, tap the
search field before typing, then the app, then "Add Widget".

### The Mac spread, and why the wide figure comes from a tablet

`branding/tools/build_shots.py` used to crop the app window out of a
full-desktop capture. That needs the Mac's screen awake AND unlocked at
the moment of the capture, and a machine that locks itself on a timer will
hand you a black frame or a lock screen instead — which is exactly what
happened here. A landscape tablet shows the same facing-page spread at
16:10, so `wide()` scales that instead and `mac_window()` waits for the
day a Mac capture is to hand. If you take one, check
`ioreg -n Root -d1 -r | grep IOConsoleLocked` first.

---

## The 2.14 set (2026-09-03) — superseded, kept for the reasoning

> The folder this section names is gone: the 2.18 set replaced it, and
> `build_shots.py` reads `branding/screenshots-2.18/` now. The commands
> below are here for the argument they make about caching, not to run.

`branding/screenshots-2.14/` held the raw captures the README and website
imagery were built from, and `branding/tools/build_shots.py` is what
builds it:

```sh
python3 branding/tools/build_shots.py
```

Phone captures go in at their own resolution (Android 1080×2400, iPhone
1206×2622); the script scales each to 1800 tall and centre-crops to 810
wide, which is the 9:20 box the site's gallery declares. The Mac capture is
a whole desktop — the script finds the app window by scanning for the light
rectangle inside the wallpaper, so a differently-placed window still crops
correctly.

Only the files the script names are kept here. To refresh the set, replace
a capture under the same name and run the script again; the hero and the
Play feature graphic come from `compose_wide.py` and are regenerated with:

```sh
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'branding/tools'); from compose_wide import hero, feature_graphic; S='branding/screenshots-2.14/'; hero('branding/github-hero.png', S+'ios-home.png', S+'ios-mushaf.png', S+'ios-duas.png'); feature_graphic('branding/play-feature-graphic.png', S+'ios-home.png')"
cp branding/github-hero.png docs/assets/img/og-hero.png
```

The script also carries a cache stamp — it writes `?v=<today>` into the
site generator's own `SHOT_V` (it used to rewrite `docs/index.html`
directly, which the generator then disowned on its next run). The filenames stay the same from one set to the next, so
without it a returning visitor is served the OLD images out of their browser
cache with nothing to tell them — which is exactly what happened when the
2.14 set went live: correct bytes on the server, August's screenshots on the
screen. The stamp is written by the same command that writes the images, so
the two cannot drift apart.

---

## The store sets (2026-09-03)

Two sizes, and only two, because they are the two Apple actually requires.
App Store Connect scales them down for every smaller class on its own, so a
6.5″ or 6.3″ set buys nothing and is one more thing to let go stale.

| Slot | Pixels | Raw shots | Captioned panels | Upload from |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| iPhone 6.9″ | 1320 × 2868 | `branding/store/ios-6.9` | `branding/store-previews` | `fastlane/screenshots/ios/6.9` |
| iPad 13″ | 2064 × 2752 | `branding/store/ipad-13` | `branding/store-previews-ipad` | `fastlane/screenshots/ipad/13` |

Raw shots are the untouched simulator captures. The captioned panels are what
goes on the product page. Both are built by one script:

```sh
python3 branding/tools/build_store.py
```

It refuses to run on a shot that is the wrong size or that still carries an
alpha channel — `simctl io … screenshot` writes RGBA, and App Store Connect
rejects any PNG with alpha, so flatten before committing:

```python
from PIL import Image
im = Image.open(path)
bg = Image.new("RGB", im.size, (255, 255, 255))
bg.paste(im, mask=im.split()[-1])
bg.save(path)
```

The caption for each panel lives in `CAPTIONS` in `build_store.py`, keyed by
the raw file's name — so the numbering in the file name is also the order the
panels appear in on the product page.

### The seven panels

| # | Screen | Why it's in |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Home — next prayer | The hero. Countdown, today's times, the ayah of the day. |
| 2 | Mushaf — Al-Baqarah, playing | The reader *with the mini player up and a word lit*, which is the one thing a static list of features can't convey. |
| 3 | Month | The whole table filled in — proof of the offline year. |
| 4 | Duas | Ayat al-Kursi with Arabic, transliteration, translation, source. |
| 5 | Tasbih | Counter part-way through a set, so it reads as used rather than empty. |
| 6 | Log | The practice grid and today's row — the journal nobody expects. |
| 7 | Qibla | iPhone only. |

Qibla is left out of the iPad set: a simulator has no magnetometer, so the
dial sits on "Starting compass…", and on a 13″ canvas that is mostly empty
page. On the iPhone it still reads, because the bearing is the whole top of
the screen.

### Capturing

Both simulators take synthetic taps, so the whole pass runs headless:

```sh
IPHONE=$(xcrun simctl list devices | grep 'iPhone 17 Pro Max' | grep -o '[0-9A-F-]\{36\}')
xcrun simctl status_bar $IPHONE override --time '9:41' \
  --batteryLevel 100 --batteryState charged --cellularBars 4 --wifiBars 3
idb ui tap --udid $IPHONE <x> <y>        # device POINTS, i.e. pixels ÷ 3
xcrun simctl io $IPHONE screenshot shot.png
```

`idb ui describe-all --udid <udid> --json` gives every element's label and
frame, which is how the taps are aimed — never guess from a screenshot's
pixels. Filter it hard; on the Log screen it prints a row per day of the year.

Two things that cost time last pass:

- A fresh simulator has no muṣḥaf pages, so the reader renders blank. Copy the
  `Documents/quran` folder across from a simulator that has already downloaded
  it (`xcrun simctl get_app_container <udid> com.hassan.prayerapp data`) —
  185 MB, and much faster than downloading again inside each device.
- Neither `simctl` nor `idb` can rotate a device. The iPad set is therefore
  portrait, where the spread reader shows one page plus the surah sidebar.
  Landscape needs the Simulator GUI and `cmd+left` / `cmd+right`.

## Google Play and F-Droid (2026-09-03)

The two Android stores want opposite things from the same screenshots, so
they get different files out of the same captures.

| Slot | Pixels | Raw shots | Goes to |
|---|---|---|---|
| Play phone | 1080 × 2160 panel | `branding/store/play` (1080 × 2400) | `branding/play-previews` |
| Play tablet | 2560 × 1440 panel | `branding/store/play-tablet` (2560 × 1600) | `branding/play-previews-tablet` |
| Play feature graphic | 1024 × 500 | built from `01_home` | `branding/store/play` |
| Play icon | 512 × 512, 32-bit | — | `branding/store/play` |
| F-Droid phone | 1080 × 2400 | the same raw shots | `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots` |
| F-Droid tablet | 2560 × 1600 | the same raw shots | `.../images/tenInchScreenshots` |

**Play gets the captioned panels, F-Droid gets the raw screenshots.** That is
each store's own convention: Play's listing is a marketing carousel, while the
F-Droid client shows the images at device width beside a description it is
already displaying, where a phone-inside-a-phone wastes most of the frame.

`python3 branding/tools/build_store.py` builds all of it, Apple's sets
included, and

```sh
python3 branding/tools/verify_store.py
```

checks every file against the rule its store actually enforces — exact
pixel size, no stray alpha, Play's aspect caps, the minimum count per slot.
It must print `ALL STORE ASSETS PASS` before anything is uploaded. It
exists because a whole Play set shipped at a ratio Play rejects and nothing
in the repo said so.

### The sizes are a rule, not a preference

Play caps a screenshot's long side at **twice** its short side. A phone
capture is 1080 × 2400 — ratio 2.22 — so **the raw shot cannot be uploaded**,
and the whole previous set (1320 × 2868, ratio 2.17, and 1080 × 2410) was out
of spec. The panel is composed at 1080 × 2160, which is exactly 2.00.

Tablet screenshots are stricter still: **16:9 landscape or 9:16 portrait
only**, 1080–7680px, at least four per slot. The tablet emulator is 2560 ×
1600 (16:10), so those panels are composed onto a 2560 × 1440 canvas by
`compose_landscape()` — text left, device bleeding off the right. Play's
seven-inch and ten-inch slots take the same files; upload the set twice.

The feature graphic and the phone panels must have **no alpha**;
`screencap` writes RGBA, so `build_store.py` refuses any raw shot that still
carries a channel it should not. The icon is the one asset Play wants as
32-bit *with* alpha.

### Capturing

```sh
export ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554          # or -5556 for the tablet
adb shell settings put global sysui_demo_allowed 1
adb shell cmd overlay enable com.android.internal.systemui.navbar.gestural
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.demo -e command enter
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.demo -e command clock -e hhmm 0941
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.demo -e command battery -e level 100 -e plugged false
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.demo -e command network -e wifi show -e level 4
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.demo -e command notifications -e visible false
adb exec-out screencap -p > shot.png
```

Demo mode is Android's answer to `simctl status_bar override`: a fixed 9:41,
a full battery and no notification icons. Switching to gesture navigation
replaces the three-button bar with a single pill, which is what a current
phone looks like.

Notes from this pass:

- `adb shell input text` sends **one** field. Tapping the next field between
  two `input text` calls does not always move focus, and both strings land in
  the first one — check the field after typing rather than after saving.
- A tablet emulator can pop Android's own "Try out your stylus" dialog over
  the app the first time a text field is focused. Dismiss it before aiming
  any more taps; its buttons sit where the app's do.
- The tablet needs the ~180 MB mushaf downloaded before the reader shows
  anything, and the progress bar sits across the top of the screen while it
  runs. Wait for it to finish before capturing the spread.
- The floating tab bar is 88% opaque by design (`translucentSurface`), so
  whatever is behind it reads through faintly. Scroll so that something quiet
  is under the bar, not a card mid-sentence.
