"""Rebuild the README and website imagery from a screenshot set.

Sources live in `branding/screenshots-2.28/` — device captures at their own
resolutions (Android 1080x2400, iPhone 1320x2868, an Android tablet at
2560x1600). This script is what turns them into the fixed shapes the README
and the site ask for, so the next set can be dropped in and the same command
run again.

  python3 branding/tools/build_shots.py

Phone shots are scaled to 1800 tall and centre-cropped to 810 wide, which is
the 9:20 box the site's gallery declares (`aspect-ratio: 9 / 20`) and the
size the README's grid has always used.

THE SPREAD is the wide one, and it comes from a TABLET now. It used to be a
Mac desktop capture with the window found by scanning for the light
rectangle inside the wallpaper — which needs a Mac whose screen is awake and
unlocked at the moment of the capture, and that is exactly what could not be
arranged for the 2.18 set. A landscape tablet shows the same facing-page
spread the Mac does, at 16:10 rather than the window's ~16:9, so it crops to
the same box and needs no window-finding at all. `mac_window` stays below for
the day a Mac capture is to hand again.
