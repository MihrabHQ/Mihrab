// driven from — therefore hands every suite React's PRODUCTION build,
// which does not export `act`. The run does not error; it reports 195
// failures across 35 suites, all of them `(0, _react.act) is not a
// function`, and every one of them is a lie. Pinned here so the suite
// means the same thing whatever shell starts it.
