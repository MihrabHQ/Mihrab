/**
 * The release notes the app shows, built from the ones the stores already get.
 *
 * ── WHY THESE NOTES AND NOT CHANGELOG.md ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * There were three candidates for "what changed", and only one of them is
 * already written in the register a reader wants.
 *
 * CHANGELOG.md is written for whoever maintains this app: entries run to a
 * couple of hundred words, they explain the fault as well as the fix, and
 * everything since 2.15.1 still sits under `[Unreleased]` because the
 * section is cut by hand. It is the better document and the wrong one to
 * open over somebody's prayer times.
 *
 * The slide copy in `whatsNew.ts` was written for the reader, but only for
 * whichever release somebody remembered to write slides for — two entries
 * in the whole history.
 *
 * `fastlane/metadata/android/<locale>/changelogs/<code>.txt` is the third:
 * fifty-eight releases of it, each already inside Play's 500-character
 * limit, each already checked by `release.sh` before a tag can exist, and
 * Arabic and Swedish already translated beside the English. It cannot go
 * stale, because a release that forgets it cannot be cut.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS GENERATED AND COMMITTED ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Those files are named by versionCode — `265.txt` — and a reader has
 * never heard of versionCode. The name and the date live in git: the tag
 * `v2.18.1` and the `build.gradle` under it. Metro cannot read git, and
 * neither can an F-Droid builder working from a tarball, so the join is
 * done here, once, and the result is committed.
 *
 * `--check` re-runs the join and fails if the committed file does not
 * match, which is what `releaseNotes.test.ts` calls. It does NOT need git
 * for a release already in the table: the version and date it found last
 * time are read back out of the generated file and reused. Git is
 * consulted for a versionCode that has appeared since — the moment
 * somebody is cutting a release, on a machine that has the tags — and for
 * an entry whose date is missing, so a table can repair itself but never
 * forget.
 *
 * The release being cut is the one case with notes and no tag: release.sh
 * writes the notes, runs this, THEN tags. It is dated today, which is what
 * the tag will say. Notes for a version higher than build.gradle's are
 * simply not in the table yet — writing the notes before the bump is the
 * right order, and it should not fail the suite in between.
