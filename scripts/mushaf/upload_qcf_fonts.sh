# The tajwīd release (`build_tajweed_assets.py fonts`) is the same shape:
# one asset per page and palette, on its own permanent tag.
#
# Re-runnable: an asset already on the release AT THE SAME SIZE is skipped, so
# an interrupted upload can simply be started again. An asset of a different
# size is REPLACED (--clobber).
#
# It used to skip by name alone. That is how twenty fonts cut short of their
# pages stayed on the release for six weeks after a correct build existed:
# the correct files were "already present" and never uploaded, and the reader
# drew the missing words in the platform's fallback face (2026-09-03).
