 *   node scripts/sync-version.js --check  # exit 1 if it is out of date
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The site carried the version in two hand-edited places
 * and drifted from the app on both — and from ITSELF: the hero said 2.8.3
 * (231) while the colophon two screens down said 2.8.2 (230), neither of
 * which was shipping. Anything a release checklist asks a human to retype
 * in two files eventually says three different things.
 *
 * `android/app/build.gradle` is the single source of truth, because it is
 * the file that cannot be wrong — it is what actually goes into the APK
 * that `aapt2 dump badging` reports. iOS is bumped in lockstep from it.
 *
 * `--check` is wired into the jest suite (`__tests__/siteVersion.test.ts`)
 * so a release cut with a stale site fails before it is tagged, not after
 * someone notices the number on the live page.
