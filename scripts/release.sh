#
# ── SKIP_CATALYST, AND WHY IT IS AN ENV VAR AND NOT A FLAG ────────────
#
# Xcode 27 made a macOS deployment target below 12.0 a build error, and
# this project's Catalyst build reports 10.15 from somewhere no build
# setting reaches: every pod target, the app target and both projects set
# to 12.0 at target AND project level did not move it, and neither did
# `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0` passed on the xcodebuild command line,
# which outranks all of them. So the Mac could not be built at all on
# 2026-09-16, with Android and iOS both ready and gated green.
#
# The honest options were to hold the whole release for the Mac or to
# ship the two platforms that work. This is the second, made explicit:
# it is an environment variable rather than a flag because it must be
# typed deliberately every time and can never be a default, and it prints
# what it is giving up rather than going quiet about it.
#
# WHAT IT SKIPS, all of it together — the Catalyst build, the signing and
# notarization gates that read the zip, the zip as a release asset, and
# the Homebrew tap bump. The cask is NOT touched: it keeps pointing at
# the last version that actually has a Mac zip, which is what keeps
# `brew install mihrab` working. verify-release.sh WILL report the Mac as
# behind, and that is correct rather than a failure to explain away.
#
# ── WHY THIS EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# It replaces a thirteen-step checklist in docs/DISTRIBUTION.md that was
# run by hand every time. Every release incident this project has had came
# from that: not from anyone being careless, but from a list of steps being
# the wrong tool for a job with an irreversible step in the middle of it.
#
#   • 2.11.0 SHIPPED AD-HOC SIGNED. `SIGN_IDENTITY` was not set, a gate
#     written `!= "-"` let it through, and codesign silently dropped every
#     entitlement: no App Group so no widget data, no widget host so
#     nothing in the gallery, no Keychain so a brand-new sync identity that
#     orphaned the old device's file in every shared folder. Signature
#     verification passed. Notarization was never reached. The checklist
#     did not mention signing at all.
#
#   • A TAG WAS PUSHED BEFORE `main` LANDED. The push failed, the tag did
#     not, and a pushed tag must never be moved — so the history had to be
#     merged around it rather than rebased.
#
#   • PLAY REJECTED THE RELEASE NOTES for being over 500 characters, and
#     that was found by `verify-release.sh` AFTER the tag and the GitHub
#     release were already public. It is a thing you can know before you
#     start.
#
#   • FIXES SAT ON `main` FOR DAYS, released to nobody, because nothing
#     ever said so out loud. Hence `--unreleased`, and hence the log this
#     prints before it asks for anything.
#
#   • macOS WIDGETS FROZE ON EVERY UPGRADE and the cask postflight that
#     fixes it was not in any checklist, because the checklist predates
#     the Mac build entirely.
#
# ── THE ONE RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Everything that can fail happens BEFORE anything that cannot be undone.
# Tests, changelog limits, signing, the built artifacts' own version
# stamps — all of it is checked while the only cost of stopping is your
# time. `git push`, the tag, the GitHub release and the tap come after,
# in that order, because each is recoverable only by the one before it
# having already succeeded.

# children, a Metro dev server, and — the one that matters —
#
#   57114 …/ios/build/catalyst-dist/Mihrab.app/…/PrayerWidgetExtension
#
# a widget extension running out of a bundle `build-catalyst.sh` had
# already deleted. That is not untidiness, it is the same failure as a
# stale LaunchServices record in process form: a live widget provider for
# this bundle identifier, answering from a path nothing else agrees with,
# beside the installed copy that is supposed to be serving the widgets.
# build-catalyst.sh reaps its own now; this catches what an interrupted or
# failed build left behind, and the rest is hygiene.
#
# EVERYTHING NAMED HERE BELONGS TO THIS REPO. Scoped to "$ROOT" on purpose
# — no `killall java`, no `pkill node`. A release must not reach into work
# that has nothing to do with it.
#
# `if`, not `[ … ] && return`: under `set -e` an AND-list whose left side
# fails takes the whole script down, which is the same class of mistake as

  # becomes the pipeline's and then the assignment's — so `set -e` ends the
  # release at the first pattern that finds nothing. Caught by running this
  # function against a decoy: it reaped the decoy, printed its line, and
  # exited 1 on the next reap. A cleanup step that kills the release it is

# ── AND PUT THE INSTALLED WIDGET BACK ─────────────────────────────────
#
# `lsregister -u <path>` takes a PATH and drops records by BUNDLE IDENTITY,
# and it does it LAZILY. Unregistering a temp copy called `Mihrab.app`
# therefore takes the plugin registration of the copy in /Applications with
# it — minutes later, so a check run straight afterwards reports everything
# fine and means nothing.
#
# Measured the hard way on 2026-08-29. A throwaway `Mihrab.app` was
# unregistered, `pluginkit` was checked immediately and listed the
# installed extension; a few minutes later the user's widgets were blank,
# and then gone from the gallery entirely. `lsregister -u` is used in three
# places in this cycle — here, in `verify-release.sh`, and in
# `build-catalyst.sh` — and each one is a chance to take the widgets down
# on the machine cutting the release.
#
# So: after any unregister, assert the installed extension back, and verify
# it STAYED rather than that the command returned 0.
#
# Captured, not piped, for the third time in this file: `pluginkit -m … |
# grep -q .` makes grep exit on the first line, pluginkit take SIGPIPE and

# ── XCODE CLOUD IS ENABLED, AND A RELEASE IS THE ONLY THING PUSHED ────
#
# Every run posts its result to GitHub as a commit status called
# `PrayerApp | Default`, and on a public repository every status is
# public. A run cancelled by the next push leaves a red X on a commit that
# earned none, beside five green GitHub Actions checks — runs #724 to #728
# were all COMPLETE/CANCELED for exactly that reason. That is what the
# pause was defending against, and for a long time it was the only defence
# available.
#
# The defence now is upstream: NOTHING IS PUSHED TO `main` EXCEPT A
# RELEASE. Work accumulates locally and goes up when a release goes up, so
# the workflow can stay enabled and still only ever see release commits.
#
# ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS AUTOMATED: the dataset crons push on their own
# schedule, roughly daily. The workflow's own start condition skips them —
# `DO_NOT_START_IF_ALL_FILES_MATCH` over `data` AND `src/providers/data`.
# The second directory was added on 2026-09-11 and is the whole reason
# enabling this is safe: every bot commit writes `data/...` *and*
# `src/providers/data/{ifis,habous}Seed.json`, so the single `data` matcher
# it had before skipped nothing at all. Check that rule before adding a
# path the crons write to.
XC="python3 $ROOT/scripts/xcode-cloud.py"

# THE ARM/DISARM TRAP IS GONE, AND SO IS THE REASON FOR IT.
#
# The workflow was kept paused because a push to `main` would otherwise
# build iOS and post a public commit status; a release armed it for a few
# seconds and a `trap` disarmed it however the run ended. The trap was the
# careful part: a release that fell over between the resume and the pause
# would have left the trigger live.
#
# What changed is upstream of all of it — nothing is pushed to `main` now
# except a release. Work accumulates locally and goes up when a release
# goes up, so "every push to main builds iOS" and "only a release builds
# iOS" became the same sentence. The workflow stays enabled, the release's
# own push starts the run, and there is no window to protect.
#
# `pause` and `resume` still exist in xcode-cloud.py for the day that
# stops being true.

# 2.11.0 through 2.13.3 all shipped unnotarized — Gatekeeper refused the
# first launch of every Mac install for eight releases, and nothing said
# so, because notarization was a comment in build-catalyst.sh asking a
# human to run notarytool afterwards. It is part of that script now, and
# this is the check that makes the flag it honours unable to matter:
# SKIP_NOTARIZE builds a zip, and this refuses to publish it.
#
# `stapler validate` AND NOT `spctl`, on this unpacked copy. The ticket is
# issued by Apple's notary service for one exact cdhash, so a ticket that
# validates against this bundle is the notarization — and stapling is the
# half that gets skipped anyway: a notarized-but-unstapled build passes
# `spctl` on any Mac that can reach Apple and blocks a user who cannot.
#
# `spctl -a` here would be worse than redundant. Assessing a bundle in a
# temp directory hands it to App Translocation and REGISTERS the
# translocated path, and the .appex record that comes with it takes the
# installed app's plugin registration down with it — every widget on this
# Mac goes blank. Measured 2026-08-29. build-catalyst.sh runs the Gatekeeper
# assessment where it is safe to: on the bundle in ios/build that it

# repo made for a year and could not keep: the trigger silently did not
# fire on 2026-08-07, and every run from #724 on was cancelled by the next
# push. A build the release starts is one the release can name.
#
# A warning and not a `die`: everything above this line is already public,
# and Apple refusing to start a run is a thing to retry rather than a
# release to unwind. The exact retry is printed at the end.
step "App Store build"
# ── SOMETIMES APPLE IS NOT THE PROBLEM AND THE DATE IS ────────────────
#
# App Store Connect has holds a release can run into that have nothing to
# do with this repo: a submission window, a review already in flight, an
# account that may not take a new build until a given day. In every one
# of those the right move is to ship everything else and start iOS later,
# and until this flag existed the only ways to do that were to comment
# out a step in the middle of a release script or to let the run fail and
# read the retry line. Both are how a release gets cut wrong at 1am.
#
# SKIP_APP_STORE=1 leaves the workflow PAUSED — nothing is sent, nothing
# is queued, and no public commit status is posted — and the closing
# summary says so and prints the one command that starts it when the hold
# lifts. Everything else about the release is unchanged.
#
# The pause itself happens up in Publishing, BEFORE the push, because with
# the workflow enabled the push is what starts a run: a skip decided here
# would skip this script's upload and leave Apple building anyway.
# ── AND SOMETIMES XCODE CLOUD IS SIMPLY DOWN ──────────────────────────

# On 2026-09-11 `POST /v1/ciBuildRuns` answered HTTP 500 for an hour —
# three attempts, including one with an explicit branch reference. That
# is not a rate limit that clears in a minute and it is not something
# this repo can fix, and until there was a second route it meant the iOS
# channel of a release simply did not happen.
#
# scripts/build-ios-appstore.sh is that second route: it archives on this
# Mac, checks the entitlements, exports with the Apple Distribution
# certificate in the login keychain, and uploads through altool with the
# same API key. It produced 2.18.5 (269), which reached App Store Connect
# VALID while Xcode Cloud was still refusing to start anything.
#
# It runs when Xcode Cloud will not, and it can be asked for outright
# with IOS_LOCAL=1. NO_IOS_LOCAL=1 turns the fallback off for a run that
# must not spend twenty minutes building here.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, because this is not free: fifteen to twenty-five minutes
# on this machine, and — the first time a newly created signing
# certificate is used — a macOS keychain prompt that blocks with no
# output until somebody clicks Always Allow. The ACL is established after
# that, so it asks once per certificate rather than once per release.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT: proof that Xcode Cloud would be green. A local export
# signs against profiles already on this Mac; a clean-checkout cloud
# build does not, which is how builds 520-522 passed here and failed
# there. Green here means the build shipped, not that the cloud is well.
