"""Talk to Xcode Cloud from the terminal, because the web UI is the only other

WHY THIS EXISTS. A release cut assumed that pushing a tag started an App Store
build. It does not — there is one workflow and it started on `main` — and on
2026-08-07 the push trigger did not fire either: `main` moved and no run
appeared for half an hour. A run started by hand picked up the same commit and
succeeded. Nothing in the repo could see any of that, so the release was
reported finished while the iOS channel had quietly not started.

NOTHING IS TRIGGERED BY A PUSH ANY MORE. The workflow is paused between
releases (`pause`/`resume` below) and scripts/release.sh arms it for the few
seconds it takes to start a run on the commit it just tagged. Two reasons, and
the second is the one that made it worth doing: a run cancelled by the next
push posts a public red X to a commit that earned none, and a build nobody
asked for is a build nobody reads.

CREDENTIALS. The same App Store Connect API key notarytool uses. Nothing here
is written down in the repo — export these first, or put them in
~/.config/mihrab/asc.json as {"keyPath":…, "keyId":…, "issuerId":…}:

    export ASC_KEY_PATH=/path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
    export ASC_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
    export ASC_ISSUER_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

    builds iOS" and "only a release builds iOS" are now the same sentence.
    This is here for the day that stops being true — a spell of pushing
    work-in-progress to `main`, or a cron that starts writing outside the

    WHY YOU WOULD. Every run this workflow starts posts a commit status to
    GitHub — context `PrayerApp | Default` — and on a public repository
    every status is public. There is no "report privately" switch in App
    Store Connect. So a run that is cancelled, rate-limited or red leaves a
    red X against the commit for anyone reading the repo, next to five green
    GitHub Actions checks, saying nothing true about the code.

    It is `isEnabled`, not the start condition: see `patch`. A paused
    workflow keeps its configuration, its history and its start condition —
    it simply does not fire, and `resume` puts it back exactly as it was.

    THE COST, and it is real: nothing builds iOS until you say so. A release
    that would have been picked up by the push to `main` then needs
    `./scripts/xcode-cloud.py start` after the tag, and `shipped` will
    report the version as never having reached App Store Connect until it
