# ── WHY THIS EXISTS, WHEN XCODE CLOUD ALREADY DOES IT ─────────────────
#
# Because Xcode Cloud is one service on one company's weather. On
# 2026-09-11 `POST /v1/ciBuildRuns` answered HTTP 500 three times running,
# including with an explicit branch reference — nothing to fix, nothing to
# retry against, and no way to ship. A release that can only go out
# through someone else's CI is a release you do not control.
#
# It is also the only way to find out that the signing assets on this Mac
# are real. Until today this account had NO distribution certificate at
# all: every App Store build Mihrab ever shipped was signed by a
# cloud-managed certificate held on Apple's side, which is a dependency
# nobody had noticed, because nothing here ever had to have one.
#
# ── WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, AND WILL NOT PRETEND TO ──────────────────────
#
# A local archive exports against provisioning profiles that already
# exist on this machine. A clean-checkout cloud build does not, which is
# precisely why builds 520-522 archived green here and died at the export
# step in the cloud on an entitlement the App ID had never been granted.
#
# So a green run of this script is NOT evidence that Xcode Cloud would be
# green. The entitlement gate below is the closest this can get: it reads
# what each embedded appex actually claims, in the built archive, and
# refuses to export when a claim is one the App ID cannot back. That is
# the specific failure that cost three builds; it is worth twenty seconds
# here rather than twenty minutes there.
