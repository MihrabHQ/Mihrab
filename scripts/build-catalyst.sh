# ── AD-HOC IS NOT "THE SAME BUILD WITHOUT NOTARIZATION" ───────────────
#
# This file used to default to ad-hoc and say the cask "works either way;
# notarization only affects Gatekeeper friction". Both halves were wrong,
# and 2.11.0 shipped to macOS because of it.
#
# An ad-hoc signature carries no team identifier, and codesign will not
# apply entitlements without one. So the app gets NO App Group — which is
# where the widget payload lives — and cannot host its WidgetKit extension
# at all. The shipped 2.11.0 had no widgets in the gallery, wrote no
# payload, and could not read the Keychain items its Developer ID-signed
# predecessor had created, so it silently generated a NEW sync identity and
# orphaned the old device's file in everyone's shared folder. One missing
# environment variable, three separate user-visible failures.
#
# The App Group gate below would have caught it. It did not run, because it
# was written as `if [ "$SIGN_IDENTITY" != "-" ]` — a check that switches
# itself off in exactly the case that needs it. So: the identity is now
# found automatically, an ad-hoc build has to be asked for by name, and the
# entitlements are asserted on the built bundle rather than inferred from
# what we intended to sign with.
#
# Output: ios/build/catalyst-dist/Mihrab-macOS-<version>.zip (+ sha256).

# ── WHICH XCODE BUILDS THE MAC: the selected one ────────────────────
#
# From 2.22.0 to 2.27 it could not be. Xcode 27 made a macOS deployment
# target below 12.0 an error, this build reported 10.15 for 105 targets,
# and nothing that set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET moved it — every pod, the
# app, both projects, the xcodebuild command line. So the Mac was pinned
# to a second Xcode 26 kept beside the real one, found here by version.
#
# The cause, found in the rewrite plan's step 5.1 (2026-09-29): a Catalyst
# build has no macOS target of its own. Xcode reads IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_
# TARGET through the SDK's iOS-to-Catalyst version map, and that map has
# no entry for 15.1 — the app's minimum — so it fell back to the Catalyst
# floor, iOS 13.1 = macOS 10.15. Catalyst builds now say 15.2 (macOS 12.1)
# through `[sdk=macosx*]` on the app target and in the Podfile, and the
# pin is gone. If this ever reports 10.15 again, look for a target whose
# iOS minimum is not in that map (SDKSettings.json, `iOSMac_macOS`) before
# anything else.

#
# Launching the app registered THIS copy — the one in ios/build — with
# LaunchServices, widget extension and all. That registration outlives the
# build: the bundle gets zipped, deleted, replaced next build, and
# LaunchServices keeps pointing at a path that no longer holds the bundle it
# remembers.
#
# What that does to the widgets is not obvious and cost an afternoon to find
# (2026-08-26). chronod launches the extension from the STALE path, the
# extension answers with a perfectly good timeline, and then the archive is
# rejected:
#
#   WidgetArchiver.ValidationError.bundleStubNotSupported
#     ("Bundle version did not match; LaunchServices DB may need to be rebuilt")
#
# Every widget, every size, gallery previews included, on the copy in
# /Applications that was never the problem. Nothing in the app is wrong and
# nothing in the app can fix it.
#
# So unregister what we registered. `-u` is scoped to one path: it does not
# touch /Applications, and it is not the `-kill -r` sledgehammer that
# rebuilds the whole database.
#
# THREE PATHS, NOT ONE, AND AFTER THE ZIP RATHER THAN BEFORE IT. The first
# version of this unregistered only the copy it launched, and only that, and
# it did not work — checked on 2026-08-26, straight after a clean build:
#
#   ios/build/catalyst-dist/Mihrab.app                          ← re-appeared
#   …/catalyst-release/…/PrayerApp.app                          ← never touched
#   …/catalyst-release/…/PrayerApp.app/…/PrayerWidgetExtension.appex
#
# Two things were wrong. Xcode registers its OWN build product, so the
# derived-data bundle and its widget extension are registered by the compile
# whether or not anything is ever launched — and that .appex is precisely
# the competing widget host. And a bundle that still exists on disk gets
# rediscovered, so unregistering the dist copy while leaving it sitting
# there buys minutes.
#
# Hence: unregister all four paths, then DELETE the bundle. The zip is the
# artifact; the .app beside it was only ever the thing we zipped, and it is
# one `unzip` away for anyone who wants to run it.
#
# Then check, and fail if a ghost survived. A build that says it cleaned up
# and did not is worse than one that says nothing — that is the whole reason
# this section had to be written twice.
#
# Users reach the same state without any of this — unzip the release, run it
# once from Downloads, drag it to Applications, empty the Trash — so the
# repair is written down in docs/release/catalyst-widgets.md rather than
# living only here.

# that built it and blocks a user who is offline.
