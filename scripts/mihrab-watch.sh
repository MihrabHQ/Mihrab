# Administration-read endpoint: a workflow's default GITHUB_TOKEN cannot read
# it and never will, because `administration` is not a key the workflow
# permissions block accepts. Counting it as coverage meant the scheduled run
# reported a permanent, unfixable "coverage changed" — a monitor filing an
# issue every week about its own configuration, which is the fastest way to
# teach someone to close this report unread.
#
# The reading is still taken, and the clone-spike alert below still uses it
# when a PAT makes it available. It is simply not something whose absence is
# news. Coverage now means the checks that CAN run: forks, and code search.

# Clone traffic is dominated by CI — F-Droid's builder and Xcode Cloud clone on

# absolute threshold would fire every single week and train you to ignore this
# report. Only a jump well past the established level is worth a word.
# Default to the FULL set, not to empty. With an empty default a first run
# that can only see forks compares "forks" against "" and — because the old
# value is blank — says nothing, so a monitor that is two-thirds blind reports
# "no change" forever and reads as an all-clear. Comparing against the full set
# instead means any missing capability is announced the first time it is
# missing, which is the only moment it is still news.
#
# Two fields, not one: `caps` is what we have ACCEPTED as the current coverage,
# `caps_seen` is the raw reading from the previous run. A change is only
# announced once the same reading has come back twice running. Retries above
# should stop the throttle flapping in the first place; this makes sure that
# even if something else turns intermittent, one bad reading cannot generate an
# alert on its own. The cost is that a genuine loss is reported a week late,
# which is the right trade for a report that only fires when it means something.
# Baselines written before traffic left the set still name it. Strip it on
# read rather than comparing against it once and calling that news — the whole
# point of #28 is that this comparison stops firing about the token.
