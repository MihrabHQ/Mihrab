# Widgets in the Homebrew (Mac Catalyst) build

The Homebrew cask ships a Mac Catalyst build signed with a Developer ID
certificate and notarized. As of 2026-08-07 that build also carries the
widget extension, so the prayer-times widget can be placed in Notification
Centre on macOS. This is the write-up of what it took, because almost none of
it fails in a way you would notice.

Build it with:

    SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Hassan El Ghamri (GAW23HT439)" \
      ./scripts/build-catalyst.sh

The Keychain half of the same build — the other restricted entitlement, the
provisioning profile it needs and the trap that costs a build — is in
`catalyst-keychain.md`.

## The four things that were wrong, in the order they were found

**1. The extension was not embedded at all.** `SUPPORTS_MACCATALYST = YES` on
the widget target is necessary but not sufficient: two `platformFilter = ios`
entries in the pbxproj (the embed build file and the target dependency) kept
it out of the Catalyst product. Both are now `platformFilters = (ios,
maccatalyst)`.

**2. The bundle identifier was rejected.** "Embedded binary's bundle
identifier is not prefixed with the parent app's" — the Catalyst app becomes
`maccatalyst.com.hassan.prayerapp`, so the extension has to follow.
`DERIVE_MACCATALYST_PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = YES` on the widget target does
that.

**3. `keychain-access-groups` made the app unlaunchable.** It is a restricted
entitlement: macOS honours it only if the bundle embeds a provisioning profile
that authorises it, and a Developer ID build signed outside Xcode has no
profile. AMFI then SIGKILLs the process before `main()`:

    maccatalyst.com.hassan.prayerapp: Unsatisfied entitlements: keychain-access-groups
    Restricted entitlements not validated, bailing out. Error … Code=-413
      "No matching profile found"
    AMFI: bailing out because of restricted entitlements.

It is gone from `Catalyst.entitlements`. The cost is that
react-native-encrypted-storage cannot reach a shared Keychain group on this
channel, so the journal, the fasting log and the coordinates fall back to
AsyncStorage — which is what they did before the app was signed at all, so
nothing regressed. Doing it properly means generating a Developer ID
provisioning profile for the Catalyst App ID with Keychain Sharing enabled and
embedding it as `Contents/embedded.provisionprofile` before signing.

**4. The extension has to be sandboxed.** macOS refuses to host an app
extension without `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`, and refuses it late:

    Failed to create extensionProcess … Code=16
      "Extension must have `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` entitlement."

Everything up to that point succeeds — the bundle installs, `pluginkit`
registers it, the widget appears in the gallery — and every timeline query
fails. Hence `ios/PrayerWidgetExtension/CatalystExtension.entitlements`,
separate from the app's, because the app must NOT be sandboxed and the
extension must be.

## The App Group name

Catalyst uses `GAW23HT439.group.com.prayerapp`; iOS keeps the plain
`group.com.prayerapp` it has always used. `MihrabAppGroup.h/.m` and
`PrayerWidgetExtension.swift` resolve this by the same rule so the writer and
the reader cannot drift apart.

Apple's guidance contradicts itself — DTS says Catalyst keeps the plain
identifier; macOS logs that group container identifiers must be prefixed by
the team ID — so the choice came from observation. With the plain name the
extension faulted on every read under chronod ("Container: (null)): accessing
preferences outside an application's container requires user-preference-read
or file-read-data sandbox access"). With the prefixed name it does not.

Being honest about the limits of that: a probe binary signed with the
extension's exact entitlements, plain group and all, reads the plain container
fine from a shell. So this is not the blanket "sandboxed processes need the
prefix" rule it appears to be; something narrower about ExtensionKit hosting
is involved and remains unexplained. The prefixed name is the one that has
never failed.

Two traps around the container, both of which cost time:

- `defaults read group.com.prayerapp` from a normal shell does NOT read the
  group container. It reads — and on write, CREATES —
  `~/Library/Preferences/group.com.prayerapp.plist`, which then masks the real
  container for every later read. Always address it by path:
  `defaults read "$HOME/Library/Group Containers/<group>/Library/Preferences/<group>"`.
- `initWithSuiteName:` / `UserDefaults(suiteName:)` returns a live-looking
  object for a group the process is not entitled to and silently drops every
  write. Non-nil proves nothing; round-tripping a value is the only test.

## What the build script now gates on

`scripts/build-catalyst.sh` fails the build rather than shipping a broken
bundle. After signing it asserts, against the SIGNED bundles (not the source
entitlement files):

- the extension carries `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`;
- the app and the extension name the same App Group.

Then it launches the app for real, because a signature that verifies is not a
bundle that runs — `codesign` verification and notarization both pass a bundle
AMFI will kill on sight. It requires the app to survive 15 seconds, and it
deletes `prayer_widget_payload_v2` from the group container beforehand and
requires the app to write it back with today's date. (Until the rewrite's
step 1.7 this was `prayer_widget_payload_v1`; the app now writes v2 alone
and removes v1, so a check on v1 would never pass.) It looks for that payload
every five seconds for a minute rather than once, and if the minute passes it
relaunches the app VISIBLY and looks again before failing — see the section
below for why a hidden launch alone is not enough to judge the app by.

## The one check that is still manual

None of the above proves the widget DRAWS. Place it — Notification Centre →
Edit Widgets → Mihrab — and look at it. If it shows prayer times, the whole
chain works. If it shows an empty card, the reader and the writer are looking
at different containers, and `MihrabAppGroup.m` is where to start.

## Every widget blank on the Mac, including the gallery (2026-08-26)

**Symptom.** All six widgets on macOS render empty — in Notification Centre,
on the desktop, and in the "Edit Widgets" gallery. Resizing one blanks it
again. iPhone and iPad are unaffected. The app itself is fine.

**What it is not.** Everything you would reasonably check comes back clean,
which is what makes this expensive to diagnose:

- the appex has `app-sandbox` and the prefixed App Group
- the group container holds a current payload with a live `days[]`
- `pluginkit` lists the extension against `com.apple.widgetkit-extension`
- app and appex are both `MACCATALYST`, both universal
- no crash reports, no AMFI kills
- every widget view has a `default:` family branch, so no size renders nothing

**What it is.** Two copies of Mihrab.app have existed on the machine, and
LaunchServices is still pointing at the one that is gone. chronod launches
the extension from the stale path, the extension returns a good timeline —
the log even says `Request ended … success` — and then the archive is
rejected on validation:

```
reload: failed with error WidgetKit.WidgetArchiver.ValidationError.bundleStubNotSupported(
  underlyingError: SimpleError.message("Bundle version did not match; LaunchServices DB may need to be rebuilt"))
```

Gallery previews are archived timelines too, which is why even they are
blank, and why "most widgets are broken" is really "all of them are".

**How the machine gets there.** On a developer's Mac, `build-catalyst.sh`
smoke-launches the app from `ios/build/catalyst-dist/` on every build; that
copy is then zipped, deleted or overwritten. The script now unregisters it
(`lsregister -u`) as its last step, so this should stop happening. On a
user's Mac the same state arrives by an ordinary route: unzip the release,
run it once from Downloads, drag it to Applications, delete the download.

**Diagnosis, in one command.** This is the fastest way from "widgets are
blank" to the actual reason:

```sh
log show --last 30m --info --debug --style compact \
  --predicate 'process == "chronod"' \
  | grep -i prayerapp | grep -iE "reload: (begin|failed)|bundleStub|Reload (fail|succ)"
```

`Reload success` means the widget host is happy and the problem is elsewhere.
`bundleStubNotSupported` means this.

Confirm the stale bundle directly:

```sh
pgrep -fl PrayerWidgetExtension   # is it running from a path you deleted?
```

**Repair.** Surgical, in this order — no full database rebuild needed:

```sh
LSR=/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister
pkill -f "PrayerWidgetExtension"          # drop the stale extension process
"$LSR" -u /path/to/the/old/Mihrab.app     # and any copy in ~/.Trash
"$LSR" -f /Applications/Mihrab.app        # re-register the real one
killall chronod                           # it comes straight back
open -g /Applications/Mihrab.app          # gives the widgets something to reload
```

Then re-run the `log show` above: every widget should report `Reload success`.

**Do not `lsregister -u` an `.appex` path.** `-u` takes a path, but the
record it drops is keyed by bundle identifier — and every copy of the widget
extension, build product and installed app alike, carries the same one.
Unregistering the build tree's `.appex` on 2026-08-27 took the INSTALLED
app's plugin registration with it: `pluginkit -m -i
maccatalyst.com.hassan.prayerapp.PrayerWidgetExtension` returned nothing at
all, which is the same blank widgets, reached from the opposite direction.
Unregister the `.app`; the plugin inside it goes with it. `build-catalyst.sh`
now also re-runs `lsregister -f /Applications/Mihrab.app` afterwards, which
is the repair above and costs nothing when it was not needed.

The authoritative check is by identifier, not `pluginkit -mA | grep`:

```sh
pluginkit -m -i maccatalyst.com.hassan.prayerapp.PrayerWidgetExtension -v
```

It should print one line, at the version you expect, with the path under
`/Applications`. `-mA` does not reliably list it and is not evidence either
way — it was `-mA` coming up empty that made the breakage above look worse
than it was, and then look fixed before it was checked properly.

## No widget in the gallery at all (2026-08-27)

Different symptom, different cause, and the one that actually shipped.
`bundleStubNotSupported` above is widgets that appear and go blank. This is
Mihrab not being offered in the widget gallery in the first place, no
extension process ever starting, and the App Group payload frozen at
whatever the last good build wrote.

One command settles it:

```sh
codesign -dv /Applications/Mihrab.app 2>&1 | grep -E "flags|TeamIdentifier"
#   flags=0x2(adhoc)          ← this
#   TeamIdentifier=not set    ← and this
```

An ad-hoc signature has no team identifier, and `codesign` cannot scope an
App Group to a team that does not exist — so it **drops every entitlement
and reports success**. `codesign --verify --strict` passes. Notarization is
not involved. The app simply has no App Group, cannot host its WidgetKit
extension, and cannot read Keychain items a Developer ID-signed build
created — so it silently generates a new sync identity too, orphaning the
old device's file in the shared folder. Three unrelated-looking failures,
one missing environment variable.

`build-catalyst.sh` used to default to `SIGN_IDENTITY=-`, and the App Group
gate that would have caught it was written `if [ "$SIGN_IDENTITY" != "-" ]`
— a check that switches itself off in precisely the case that needs it.
2.11.0 shipped to macOS that way. The script now finds a Developer ID
identity itself, fails if there is none, requires `SIGN_IDENTITY=-` to be
asked for by name, and asserts `TeamIdentifier` on the signed bundle before
any of the other checks.

**Repair:** rebuild signed and replace the bundle. Then confirm all three:

```sh
codesign -dv /Applications/Mihrab.app 2>&1 | grep TeamIdentifier   # = GAW23HT439
pluginkit -m -i maccatalyst.com.hassan.prayerapp.PrayerWidgetExtension -v
defaults read "$HOME/Library/Group Containers/GAW23HT439.group.com.prayerapp/\
Library/Preferences/GAW23HT439.group.com.prayerapp" prayer_widget_payload_v2 \
  | grep -o '20[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]' | head -3   # today's date among them
```

**Why iOS and iPadOS cannot hit it.** There is no LaunchServices, and an
installed app exists at exactly one path — there is no second copy for a
registration to point at, and no way for a user to run one from elsewhere.
This is a macOS-only failure by construction.

## Every widget removed on every upgrade (2026-08-29)

The third distinct macOS-only failure, and the one users notice hardest.
Not blank cards, not a missing gallery entry — the placed widgets are
**gone** from Notification Center after a `brew upgrade`, and have to be
dragged back one at a time.

One command settles it:

```sh
pluginkit -mAvvv | grep -i -A6 prayerwidget      # ← nothing at all
```

Replacing the app deletes the bundle the widget extension lived in, and
PlugInKit's record goes with it. Records are keyed by bundle identifier, so
the copy Homebrew stages a moment later is not what comes back, and nothing
re-registers it. WidgetKit with no registered provider does not draw a
stale card — it drops the widget, and the app leaves the gallery too.

Measured straight after a `brew upgrade` to 2.13.3, on a Mac whose widgets
had been working:

```sh
pluginkit -mAvvv | grep -ci prayerwidget                        # 0
lsregister -dump | grep -ci PrayerWidgetExtension               # 0
lsregister -dump | grep -c "/Applications/Mihrab.app"           # present
mdls -name kMDItemLastUsedDate /Applications/Mihrab.app         # yesterday
```

So LaunchServices knew the app and PlugInKit did not know its extension.
Three things that look like they should fix it and do not:

| Tried | Result |
|---|---|
| `lsregister -f /Applications/Mihrab.app` | extension still unregistered |
| `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine …` then `lsregister -f` | still unregistered |
| `killall -u "$USER" pkd` | still unregistered |

What does work is `pluginkit -a`, and it works with the quarantine flag
still on the bundle — which matters, because Homebrew quarantines casks by
default:

```sh
pluginkit -a /Applications/Mihrab.app/Contents/PlugIns/PrayerWidgetExtension.appex
killall chronod
```

**But not if you run it during the upgrade.** One `pluginkit -a` in the
cask postflight registers the extension and then loses it a second later.
Polled once a second across a `brew reinstall`:

```
13:09:07  registered=1   ← the postflight's pluginkit -a
13:09:08  registered=0   ← gone
13:10:23  registered=0   ← still gone 75s later
```

The uninstall step's delete of the old bundle is processed asynchronously,
after the postflight has finished, and the record is keyed by bundle
identifier — so the late event drops the registration that was just made,
and the new bundle at the same path does not protect it. The postflight
therefore registers, waits, checks that it *stayed*, and repeats until it
did. Same measurement with the loop in place:

```
13:11:43  registered=1   ← second pass
13:13:30  registered=1   ← still there, app never launched
```

Launching the app once does the same thing, because launching is what
registers an app's own extensions — which is why this looked like it
"fixed itself" for anyone who opened Mihrab after upgrading, and never did
for anyone who only ever used the widgets.

**The fix is in the cask**, next to the chronod restart and for the same
reason: the postflight is the only code that runs at the moment the app is
replaced. `release.sh` and `verify-release.sh` both gate on the cask
containing it, exactly as they do for `chronod`.

**Repair on a Mac that upgraded before the fix shipped:** run the two
commands above, then drag the widgets back once. The placement itself
cannot be restored by anything — WidgetKit discarded it when the provider
disappeared — but it will survive every upgrade after this one.

**Not the same as the ad-hoc failure above.** That one has no extension to
register (no team identifier, no entitlements). Check `codesign -dv` first:
if `TeamIdentifier` is set and `pluginkit` is empty, it is this.

## Unpacking the zip is enough to make a ghost (2026-08-29)

A footnote to the 2026-08-26 section above, and the reason it kept coming
back. A LaunchServices record does not need a launch, or a Gatekeeper call,
or anything else deliberate:

```sh
ditto -x -k Mihrab-macOS-2.13.3.zip "$(mktemp -d)"
lsregister -dump | grep Mihrab.app     # ← the temp copy is in there
```

`release.sh` and `verify-release.sh` both unpack the zip to inspect its
signature, and both had been leaving a registered copy behind on every
release, at a temp path that is deleted moments later. That is precisely
the stale record that blanks every widget on the machine. Both now
unregister the path before removing it.

`spctl -a` on an unpacked copy is worse: Gatekeeper hands it to App
Translocation and registers *that* path too, `.appex` included — and an
`.appex` record takes the installed app's plugin registration down with it,
because the records are keyed by bundle identifier. So the notarization
checks in those two scripts use `stapler validate`, which does not invoke
Gatekeeper, and the one Gatekeeper assessment lives in `build-catalyst.sh`
against the bundle in `ios/build` that it already registers and cleans up.

The sweep that cleans this up also has a trap worth knowing about:

```sh
lsregister -dump | grep -oE '^path: +/[^ ]*Mihrab\.app$'    # matches NOTHING
```

`lsregister -dump` writes `path:  /Applications/Mihrab.app (0x42c4)` — the
trailing record id means a `$` anchor never matches, and the sweep reports
success having done nothing. Drop the anchor.

## The extension outlives the app, and then the bundle (2026-08-29)

`build-catalyst.sh` smoke-launches the signed app and kills it afterwards.
Killing the app is not killing the widget: registering that copy is enough
for chronod to ask it for a timeline, and the `.appex` it starts is a
separate process with its own lifetime. It survived the app, then survived
the `rm -rf` of the bundle it lives in — found hours after a release build
had finished:

```sh
$ pgrep -alf PrayerWidgetExtension
57114 …/ios/build/catalyst-dist/Mihrab.app/…/PrayerWidgetExtension
```

A live widget provider for this bundle identifier, answering from a path
that no longer exists, beside the installed copy that is supposed to be
serving the widgets. Same failure as a stale LaunchServices record, in
process form. `build-catalyst.sh` reaps it after the launch now, and
`release.sh` has a `Cleanup` step that catches whatever an interrupted
build left behind — along with the Gradle daemon, orphaned jest workers,
and a Metro dev server for this repo, all scoped to the repo path.

Worth knowing how little it takes to make one of these. While testing that
cleanup, a *fake* bundle — a directory named `Mihrab.app` containing one
shell script, no `Info.plist` — was registered by LaunchServices simply
because a process was launched from inside it.

## The hidden launch never writes the payload on a sleeping Mac (2026-09-13)

**Symptom.** `release.sh 2.19.0` — twenty-eight commits, every other gate
green — died at the macOS step on `✗ … has no payload for today`. The app
launched, survived its fifteen seconds, and wrote nothing.

**What it is not.** Not the entitlement, not the App Group name, not a stale
bundle, and not a location: the SHIPPED 2.18.5 in `/Applications`, built and
verified weeks earlier, failed the identical check on the same machine that
day. Whatever was wrong was not in the build.

**What it is.** `open -g -j` launches hidden, and hidden is not merely quiet:
the scene never becomes foreground-active, so the screen that writes
the widget payload (`prayer_widget_payload_v1` then, `_v2` since the
rewrite) never runs its data effect. Somebody sitting at the
Mac resolves this without noticing. A Mac whose display has gone to sleep does
not.

**Measured, on that shipped 2.18.5, payload deleted first each time:**

```
hidden  (open -g -j)   90s   nothing
visible (open)         10s   {"dayLabel":"Sun, Sep 13","rows":[…
```

**What changed.** The gate still launches hidden — the polite way stays the
default, because a build should not throw a window onto whatever you are
doing. But an empty minute now buys a visible relaunch and a second minute
before the build is failed. The distinction is the point: if the visible
launch is also empty, the app really cannot compute times and the failure is
earned. A sleeping Mac costs one window; it used to cost the release.

## The deprecated `postflight` cannot be migrated (2026-09-14)

Homebrew 7 deprecated the cask `postflight do … end` block in favour of
`postflight_steps`, and prints a warning on every `brew` command that
touches the cask:

```
Warning: Calling `postflight` is deprecated! Use `postflight_steps` instead.
  …/Casks/mihrab.rb:91
```

The obvious fix — rename the stanza and translate its two `system_command`
calls into the new DSL (`run` for the `pluginkit` loop, the native
`terminate_process "chronod"` for the daemon) — passes `brew style` and
`brew audit`, and is a **trap**. The steps DSL runs each `run` step inside
Homebrew's install sandbox (`Sandbox.available?` is true on macOS), and
`pluginkit -a` needs unsandboxed IPC to `pkd` to register an extension.
Under the sandbox it just fails.

**Measured live on 2026-09-14**, with a diagnostic `postflight_steps` that
printed what it resolved and what `pluginkit` returned:

```
DIAG appdir=[/Applications]          ← the {{appdir}} template expanded fine
DIAG appex=exists                    ← the path was correct
DIAG add_exit=1                      ← pluginkit -a FAILED under the sandbox
DIAG registered=no                   ← the extension was dropped
```

The same `pluginkit -a`, run by hand in a normal shell, registered the
extension on the first pass. So it is not the path, not the template, not
the command — it is the sandbox, and there is no `run` option to opt out of
it. `terminate_process` (chronod) is a native step and works; only the
registration is blocked. A `postflight_steps` cask therefore installs
cleanly, satisfies a bare "postflight" grep, and silently loses every
upgrading Mac its widgets — the exact 2026-08-29 failure, re-introduced by
the migration meant to be routine.

**Decision:** keep the legacy `postflight do` block. It runs unsandboxed,
`pluginkit -a` works, and the deprecation warning is cosmetic — the block
still executes. The warning stays until Homebrew either gives `run` an
unsandboxed escape hatch or removes `postflight` outright, at which point
the registration needs a different mechanism (a launch, a login item, or an
upstream fix), not a mechanical rename.

**The gate.** `release.sh` and `verify-release.sh` no longer accept a bare
"postflight": they reject a `postflight_steps` stanza by name and require
the literal `postflight do` block, so the migration cannot be shipped by
anyone who silences the warning without knowing what it costs.
