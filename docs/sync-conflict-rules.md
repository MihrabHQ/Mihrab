# What sync does with a disagreement

Every device holds the whole record and no server arbitrates, so the merge
has to be an algebra: **commutative, idempotent, associative**. Two devices
that have met converge whatever order they met in, and a snapshot merged
with itself is itself. `src/sync/merge.ts` is the whole of it.

That shape has one blind spot, and this file exists because the project has
now walked into it five times.

## The blind spot: an absence loses

A union only grows and a max only rises. Neither can express **"this is
gone"** — a deleted row is simply absent from the snapshot, and absent is
indistinguishable from *not made yet*. So the device that still holds the
row wins by default, and the removal undoes itself on the next round.

Every occurrence, and what fixed it:

| Reported as | Where | The dated fact that fixed it |
|---|---|---|
| "removing a device un-removes itself within two minutes" | peers | `removedPeers.ts` — `{pk, at}`, 90-day TTL |
| a cleared sunnah day came back | sunnah | an emptied day kept, with its `at` |
| a cleared prayer came back | journal | `status: 'cleared'` — a clear is a WRITE |
| an abandoned khatmah came back | khatmah plan | `abandonedAt` tombstone |
| an un-marked page came back | khatmah pages | `AyahMark` — dated claims replayed over the union |
| **a khatmah pin came back, and dragged progress back to it** | khatmah pin | `positionAt` |
| **a deleted bookmark came back** | bookmarks | `bookmarksRemoved` |
| **an un-starred ayah came back** | stars | `starsRemoved` + `starsAt` |
| **a deleted fast came back** | fasting | `FastEntry.cleared` |

The rule, stated once: **anything a reader can take away has to be able to
say so, with a date on it.** A removal is a write.

## The second blind spot: an undated fact loses to a dated one

`done` — which ayahs a khatmah has read — merges by union and carries no
times. The un-marks beside it carry times. So a stretch un-marked on the
phone on Monday and *read* on the Mac on Tuesday merged as Monday's denial
replayed over Tuesday's reading: the progress fell back to the first gap,
every round, until the claim aged out at ninety days. Two facts can only be
ordered if both are dated, so **reading is a dated claim now too**
(`recordKhatmahProgress`), and the log stays small because `compactMarks`
resolves it into the verdicts it amounts to instead of appending for ever.

**Every read keeps its own time (2026-09-22).** Neighbouring reads used to
be joined at the *earlier* of their times, on the reasoning that the
earlier time can only lose to a claim it truly predates. It cannot: a whole
khatmah's reading collapsed into one claim dated at its first page turn,
and any denial made on the other device after that date — a "continue from
here" pin, an un-marked page, a rewind — beat every page this device read
*after* the denial but before the next sync, because the join had backdated
them. Reported as "progress on my phone is reset on sync to whatever point
the other device holds". Joining at the later time fails the other way
round (today's page turn re-asserts ground claimed days ago over an un-mark
made in between). So nothing is joined: the log is one claim per page read
plus the denials, a later claim cuts an earlier one out of the ground it
covers, a denial is never cut by reading (only by a later denial — the
peer still holds it at the width it was made), and a page turn over ground
the log already says is read adds nothing. A finished khatmah is about six
hundred claims; the cap (1024) is a backstop.

**Today's cut on a dated plan carries when it was cut** (`pace.at`). Two
devices used on the same day without a sync between them each cut the day
from their own reach, and the one that was behind cuts a day out of pages
the other read last week. Earliest-wins — right when both cuts came from
the same frontier — took the stale one, and the phone's day was "done" the
moment it synced. The log tells the two apart: the ground between the cuts
was read *before* the lower cut was made, so it was stale the moment it was
made (`pickPace`); and a lone cut, adopted by a device that has not read
today, is judged the same way (`paceStillFits`).

The two-device fuzz (`syncTwoDeviceFuzz.test.ts`) walks all of this:
random reading, finishes, pins, un-marks, rewinds and days on two devices
syncing both ways, checking after every round that they agree, that what
they agree on is the reader's latest word per ayah, that a device is never
moved back by a peer that did nothing to its reading, and that today's cut
is never a stale one.

## The third: a field nobody decided

`mergeKhatmah` built its result with `{...mine, ...incoming}` and then
reconciled the fields it had thought about. Everything else took the
incoming side's value unconditionally — which is not commutative, and which
handed `dayStartDate` and the two numbers beside it to whichever device
happened to be read second. A phone that had not been opened for a week
reset the Mac's "today" to last week's baseline.

Day-start state is **per-device** and never travels. `fromPage` is set once
and never edited, so it is merged by a rule that reads the same on both
devices (min) rather than by spread order. `targetDays` used to be in that
sentence too; it is edited now (a khatmah can be re-paced mid-way, in
either direction), so it travels with the date as one dated decision —
see the pacing row below.

## The table

| Kind | Rule | Can a removal travel? |
|---|---|---|
| prayers (journal) | LWW per `(date, prayer)` on `loggedAt` | yes — `status: 'cleared'` |
| fasting | LWW per `(date, type)` on `loggedAt`; a clear wins a tie | yes — `cleared`, 90-day TTL |
| dhikr (tasbih) | `Math.max` per day | **no** — see below |
| sunnah | whole-day LWW on `at`; per-field max for undated days | yes — dated empty day, 90-day TTL |
| quran · bookmarks | LWW by id on `updatedAt ?? createdAt` | yes — `bookmarksRemoved`, 90-day TTL |
| quran · stars | union, minus removals newer than the star | yes — `starsRemoved` + `starsAt` |
| quran · lastRead | whole-object LWW on `updatedAt` | n/a — one value |
| quran · prefs | whole-object LWW on `prefsUpdatedAt` | n/a — one value |
| quran · khatmah plans | per-id; union of `done`, dated claims replayed over it | yes — `abandonedAt`, `AyahMark`, `positionAt` |
| quran · khatmah, which plan is live | one: the most reading inside its own span, then the latest `startedAt`, then the higher id (`oneLivePlan`); the rest set aside with `supersededBy`, never abandoned. The marker is not merged: it is cleared and worked out again from the merged plans on every merge, every read of a stored blob and every write, so devices that saw each other's reading at different times converge on one plan (a choice stored as `abandonedAt` could leave none). There is one khatmah: when the reader finishes or abandons the kept plan, the plans set aside behind it are abandoned at the same moment (`endSetAside`, a real tombstone that travels), and starting a new khatmah abandons them too. A merge alone never ends a plan | yes, for the ending — the plans set aside carry `abandonedAt`; the choice itself is derived |
| quran · khatmah pacing (`targetDays` + `deadline` + `pacedDay` + `pacedFrom`) | newest `pacedAt` wins and takes the whole set; equal stamps → a duration wins, then the later date, then the longer length | yes — the stamp survives the date, so "no deadline" travels |
| quran · khatmah day cut (`pace`) | goes with the date it was cut for; between two cuts for the same date, later `day` wins and within a day the EARLIEST cut (smallest `from`) | n/a — one value, replaced daily |
| settings, location | incoming wins per top-level field | **no** — see below |

### Two left as they are, on purpose

**Dhikr counts** merge with `Math.max` per day, so a count can never be
*lowered* across devices. Summing would double every day on every re-sync
(the idempotence the cycle rests on), and a per-day dated claim would make
a tap counter carry a log. Somebody who over-counts a day can still correct
it on the device they over-counted it on; what they cannot do is correct it
on a second device and have the lower number win. That is a real limitation
and a cheap one: the failure is a number that is too high, not a record
that disappears.

**Settings and location** have no timestamps anywhere in the store, so
there is nothing honest to compare and the incoming device's fields win.
Unlike the record, a preference is not a fact about the past that can be
lost — and a field the snapshot does not mention is left alone, so an older
build cannot erase a setting it has never heard of. If a stale device ever
starts talking over newer settings in practice, the fix is the one
`prefsUpdatedAt` already demonstrates: give the blob a write time.

### Why the pacing is one row and not three

`targetDays` and `deadline` are two ways of saying the same thing — "in
thirty days" and "by the 30th" — and the reader switches between them
mid-khatmah. Settled separately, "in 14 days" from the phone and "by 3
October" from the Mac merge into a plan that is neither: the phone's
length with the Mac's date, which nobody chose and which the card would
then report as a date. So the pair is picked from ONE side, with
`pacedFrom` and `pacedDay` (where the reader stood and which day the
store was on when the decision was taken — what the schedule is measured
from) coming along with it, and with today's cut when the two sides had
cut it for different dates: a cut is "what is left over the days that
remain", so it belongs to the date it was made for.

### Why the day's cut is synced and the day's baseline is not

They look like the same kind of thing and they are not. `dayStartDate` and
the numbers beside it answer *"how much has happened since MY day began"* —
a fact about one device's morning, which is why they stay local. A deadline
plan's `pace` answers *"how much is due today"*, which is a fact about the
PLAN: two devices that disagree about it show the reader two different
quotas for the same day. So the cut travels, and within a day the earliest
one wins — the first device to open the day pinned it, and a later device
must not re-cut it against reading that has happened since, or today's
portion would shrink as it was read.

## If you add a field to a synced blob

1. Can the user remove it, or lower it? If so it needs a **date**, and the
   merge has to read that date — `absent` will not do.
2. Does the merge decide it explicitly, or is it riding on a spread? Write
   the rule down; a field nobody decided is a field that depends on which
   device asked.
3. Add it to the table above, and to `__tests__/syncRemovalsTravel.test.ts`
   if it can be taken away.
