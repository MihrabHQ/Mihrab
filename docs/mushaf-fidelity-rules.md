# Mushaf fidelity: what may adapt, and what may not

The mushaf must match the printed Madinah page **page for page and line for
line**, so that "page 152, third line" means the same thing in the app as in
the physical copy. That is what makes the reader usable for memorisation and
for finding a place someone quotes.

## Invariant — never negotiable

**A page's lines, and each line's words, come from the layout data and are
never reflowed.** Nothing about screen size can move a word to a different
line or a line to a different page. The renderer draws line *n* with the words
the print puts on line *n*, or it draws nothing. Line wrapping is not merely
disabled: the concept does not exist in this renderer.

This is already enforced structurally — `MushafTextPage` draws each line as
one run of exactly the words the data lists, with `numberOfLines={1}`. There
is no code path that could wrap.

**Not wrapping is not the same as not losing a word.** A single line is laid
out by BREAKING it and drawing only the first line, so a run even a hair wider
than its box loses everything after the last break — not a sliver of ink, a
whole word, with no error anywhere. Page 49 shipped like that: all fifteen
lines ended one word early. Two things keep it from recurring:

- The gap between two words is drawn in a font we ship (`AmiriQuran`) at a
  size derived from that font's own space advance, so the drawn width of a
  line is the width we computed rather than whatever face the platform falls
  back to — the QPC page fonts carry no space glyph at all, and the fallback
  differs between iOS and Android.
- **A line is never allowed to be wider than its box.** `MUSHAF_LINE_BOX_SLACK_EM`
  is reserved out of the page block for exactly this, and it is load-bearing:
  measured on a Pixel, removing it brought the missing words straight back.

A no-break gap character (U+00A0) is worth having and we use it, but it is
*not* what saves the line, and it is worth knowing why. Android has nowhere to
break such a line, so it breaks between glyphs instead — and in QPC a glyph is
a whole word, so the line loses its last one anyway. Nothing but fitting the
box prevents that.

### The native line view

All of the above is the `<Text>` path, and since 2.25.2 it is the fallback. A
build that carries the native line view (`native/MushafLineView.ts`; `MushafLine`
on Android and iOS/Catalyst) draws each line with the pen: the same pieces —
glyph runs and solved gaps, washes, the medallion's ink — handed to a canvas
that measures every word with the platform's own shaper and puts the pen where
the layout says. A pen does not break, so a run a hair wide lands a hair
further left and nothing is lost; and a canvas does not clip to a text view, so
the ink that overshoots the line's ends lands in the room the view is given.
That changes three numbers, and the page is set about a tenth larger for it:

- `lineBoxSlackEm()` is **0** on that path (the half em stays for `<Text>`),
  so a line's box is the run itself and the widest line spans the block;
- the ink past the line ends has its own room — `MUSHAF_INK_RIGHT_EM` (0.36,
  past the first glyph's advance) and `MUSHAF_INK_LEFT_EM` (0.2), measured by
  `scripts/mushaf/measure_ink_overshoot.py` over all 604 fonts — padded into
  the line's view and pulled back with margins, exactly as `lineInkPadding`
  does above and below;
- the page inset is `MUSHAF_PAGE_INSET_EM` of the page font (0.4 em), sized
  to hold that overshoot, instead of 3.5% of the block, and the phone column's
  own padding is 4dp. Page 146's first word overshoots by more than half the
  old slack and used to lose the tail of its swash; now nothing on any page
  reaches the edge.

Every reader of the page geometry — hit-testing, the word reader, the
follow-scroll, the previews — takes the block width from `pageBlockEm`, which
knows which path is drawing, so nothing else had to learn the difference.

### Token order

The glyphs of a line are drawn in the order QPC numbers them, in a
right-to-left paragraph, with **no bidi control characters at all**.

The renderer used to wrap a token in an LTR override (U+202D…U+202C) when it
had more than one glyph, and leave single-glyph tokens bare. That put two
kinds of run in one paragraph, and the bidi algorithm reordered the overridden
ones against their neighbours: page 49 drew `وَإِن ۞ كُنتُمْ` where the print
puts the rub-el-hizb first, and 2:2 drew `لَا ۛ فِيهِ ۛ رَيْبَ` for
`لَا رَيْبَ ۛ فِيهِ ۛ`. Uniform bare tokens render correctly on both platforms
— including every multi-glyph word of pages 1 and 2, the case the override was
added for in the first place.

## What may adapt to the screen

Only two things, and both are bounded:

### 1. Word spacing

A line is spaced to fill the measure. The space is SOLVED for — the gap that
makes `natural + gaps × space` equal the measure.

**On an ordinary page that gap is almost nothing, because the print's word
spacing is already inside the glyph advances.** Measured off the KFGQPC scans
(`scripts/mushaf/measure_print_spacing.py`, 2026-09-23): fitting each line's ink width to
`em × (natural + gaps × space)` gives a space of 0.014 em on page 125 and
−0.03 em on page 290 — i.e. none. The widest line of a page is set with its
words touching, and every other line adds only what closes the ~2% between its
advances and that measure; the visible gap between words, a median 0.11–0.13
em, is the glyphs' own side bearings. So an ordinary line's space runs from
`QPC_WORD_SPACE_EM` (0) up to whatever the print asks, capped only by
`WORD_SPACE_CEILING_EM` as a guard on the data. A quarter em had been assumed
for years, which set every page a seventh narrower than the print and every
gap two to four times its width.

**On a framed plate (pages 1–2)** the space may only move inside
`WORD_SPACE_MIN_EM … WORD_SPACE_MAX_EM`, around a nominal `WORD_SPACE_EM`:

- Below the minimum, letterforms of adjacent words start to touch — the QPC
  calligraphy interlocks by design and needs room to read.
- Above the maximum, the line stops looking like a line of the mushaf and
  starts looking like justified web text pulled apart. Page 1's basmalah at
  full justification was the cautionary case: 6.7 em of text dragged across a
  12 em plate.

**If a plate's line cannot reach the measure within that band, it is centred
at its natural width rather than stretched further.** Short lines — the last
line of a surah, the plate pages — are meant to be short; a surah's closing
line is centred at the page's nominal space on every page.

### 2. Overall scale

The font size comes from the page's widest line **as drawn** — `pageMeasureEm()`.
On an ordinary page that is the advance-only `measure` in the data, since the
print adds nothing between the words (§1); on a plate it is the advances plus
the nominal space per gap. Every page then renders at the same physical width,
which is why the text does not jump size as you turn pages, even though the
604 fonts are drawn at different design sizes.

### 3. Tajwīd colours

A second set of page faces, off by default (Settings → Quran → Tajweed
colours): the King Fahd Complex's QPC V4 tajwīd fonts, which carry the
same glyph codes as V2 with each letter's rule painted in the Complex's
ink — grey silent, green ghunnah, four reds by madd length, light blue
qalqalah, dark blue tafkhīm. They are COLR/CPAL fonts and the native line
view draws them as such; the `<Text>` fallback does not, so the colours
are Hafs-only and only on the page-font surface.

What may change with the set, and what may not:

- The V4 faces are cut from the 1441H Madinah print, which keeps the
  same words on the same pages as the print V2 follows but breaks 377
  of the 604 pages into different lines (page 76 ends Āl ʿImrān on its
  last line; An-Nisāʾ's plate opens page 77). A V4 glyph is justified
  for the line it sits on in ITS print, so the tajwīd set has its own
  line data, `mushafLayoutV4.json` — the 1441H lines from QUL's layout
  19, V2's word positions and markers, the V4 fonts' advances — in the
  same shape as `mushafLayoutV2.json`. It is read when
  `setMushafGlyphSet('tajweed')` is live (the readers apply it from
  their render, before the first `getPageLayout` of the frame); the
  plain set never reads it, and it never reads V2's file. The measure
  is the widest V4 line and the font size follows it. Laid on V2's lines
  instead, V4's words came out 14.9–20.8 em wide on one page, the font
  size collapsed to the widest, and the surah's last line sat centred
  in a gap it was never cut for — which is what page 76 looked like.
- The page's own ink: the text, the marks and the medallion's outline are
  pointed at the palette's "foreground" entry, so the reader's tone and
  the reading marker colour them as they colour V2. The medallion's
  three fills are cleared. Only the rule colours are the font's.
- Two files per page, one per palette (`QCF4T{page}L.ttf` / `…D.ttf`),
  because neither platform lets the app pick a palette at draw time; the
  store fetches the one the tone needs (`tajweedFontSet`).

Built by `scripts/mushaf/build_tajweed_assets.py` (`fonts` for the faces,
manifest and advances; `rules` for `assets/quran/tajweed/{NNN}.json`, the
per-word rule spans behind the āyah sheet's Tajweed section and the guide,
from quran.com's `text_uthmani_tajweed`). The rule catalogue — ids, inks,
examples — is `src/quran/tajweed/rules.ts`. The 1441H lines are built
by `scripts/mushaf/build_v4_layout.py`, after the advances.

## Single page vs dual page

The decision is about **available width per page**, not about the device name.
A phone in landscape and an iPad in portrait can present similar widths, and
the reader should do the same sensible thing in both.

```
usablePageWidth = (window.width − chrome) / 2      // if we paired
dual page  ⟺  usablePageWidth ≥ MIN_DUAL_PAGE_DP
              AND window.width > window.height     // landscape only
```

- `MIN_DUAL_PAGE_DP` is the narrowest a single page may be and still read
  comfortably. Below it, two pages side by side means text too small to read,
  which is worse than one page.
- A phone in landscape fails the width test (half of ~800 dp is ~400 dp, and
  each page would be a narrow column), so it stays single — which is why
  `MushafPhoneReader` never pairs.
- An iPad in landscape passes it comfortably and pairs, matching how a
  physical mushaf falls open.
- An iPad in portrait shows one page, centred, at a comfortable width rather
  than stretched to the full tablet width.

### Never stretch a single page to fill a wide screen

When a single page is shown on a wide screen (iPad portrait, a resized Mac
window), the page is capped at `MAX_SINGLE_PAGE_DP` and centred. Filling a
13-inch tablet with one page makes the text absurdly large and the line
spacing unnatural; the print has a page width, and past a point we should add
margin instead of scale.

## Where these live

- `QPC_WORD_SPACE_EM`, `WORD_SPACE_MIN_EM` / `WORD_SPACE_MAX_EM`, `WORD_SPACE_EM`,
  `MUSHAF_SPACE_ADVANCE_EM`, `MUSHAF_LINE_BOX_SLACK_EM` / `lineBoxSlackEm`,
  `MUSHAF_INK_*_EM`, `MUSHAF_PAGE_INSET_EM`, and the
  `pageMeasureEm` / `pageBlockEm` / `lineSpaceEm` / `lineWidthEm` /
  `lineTokenStream` model — `mushafLayout.ts`, kept free of React Native so
  the tests replay exactly what the renderer draws
- The native line view — `src/quran/native/MushafLineView.ts` (and its
  codegen spec beside it), `android/.../MushafLineView.kt`,
  `ios/PrayerApp/MushafLine.swift`
- `MIN_DUAL_PAGE_DP` / `MAX_SINGLE_PAGE_DP` — `mushafSpread.ts`, used by
  `MushafSpreadReader`
- Phone landscape zoom (`LANDSCAPE_ZOOM`) — `MushafPhoneReader`, bounded by
  the same "never too large" instinct as `MAX_SINGLE_PAGE_DP`

## How to check it

`scripts/mushaf/verify_mushaf.py` proves the content invariant: every glyph of
all 604 pages matches an independent copy of the QPC data. It also replays the
renderer's justification over every line of every page (`check_spacing`) and
ties `MUSHAF_SPACE_ADVANCE_EM` to the font binary we ship (`check_gap_font`).

`__tests__/mushafLayout.test.ts` runs the same two checks on every build, so a
line that would be drawn wider than its measure fails CI rather than reaching
a reader.
