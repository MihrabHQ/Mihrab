# Distribution

How Mihrab gets from a `git push` to a user's phone. Three independent channels share one `main` branch.

       fdroidRelease APK         playRelease AAB        Xcode Cloud build
       built by F-Droid CI       uploaded manually      from `main` push or
       from a public tag         to the Play Console    `vX.Y.Z` tag → TestFlight
```

The Android `app/build.gradle` declares two product flavors (`fdroid` / `play`) plus a `beta` build type that sits next to release via `.beta` `applicationIdSuffix`. The iOS project has a single target that Xcode Cloud builds for both App Store and TestFlight.

## 1. Shared release flow (everyone first)

```sh
./scripts/release.sh --unreleased    # what is on main and has never shipped
./scripts/release.sh 2.14.0 --dry-run   # every check, and every build, then stop
./scripts/release.sh 2.14.0             # the whole thing
```

**One command, and it is the only supported way to cut a release.** It
bumps both platforms, stamps the site and the F-Droid recipe, builds all
three artifacts, publishes the tag, the GitHub release and the Homebrew
cask, and then runs `verify-release.sh` against what is live.

### Why it is a script and not a list

This section used to be that list, and §6 used to be a thirteen-step
version of it. Every release incident this project has had came out of
them — not from carelessness, but because a checklist is the wrong shape
for a job with an irreversible step in the middle:

| What happened | What the list said about it |
|---|---|
| 2.11.0 shipped **ad-hoc signed** — no team identifier, so codesign dropped every entitlement: no App Group, no widget data, no Keychain, and a new sync identity that orphaned every paired device's file | nothing; signing was not a step |
| A **tag was pushed before `main` landed**, naming a commit nobody could fetch — and a pushed tag is never moved here, so history had to be merged around it | right order, no enforcement |
| **Play rejected the release notes** at 500+ characters, found *after* the tag and release were public | nothing |
| **Fixes sat on `main` for days**, released to nobody, because nothing said so out loud | nothing |
| **Every Mac's widgets froze on upgrade**, fixed only by the cask's `postflight` | the list predates the Mac build |
| **Every Mac's widgets were removed on upgrade** — replacing the app drops the extension's PlugInKit record and nothing re-registers it, so WidgetKit has no provider and discards the placement | same postflight, second failure, found only because a user said so |
| **Eight releases shipped unnotarized**, 2.11.0 to 2.13.3 — Gatekeeper blocked the first launch of every Mac install and the cask carried a caveat apologising for it | notarization was a comment in `build-catalyst.sh` asking a human to run `notarytool`, and this file never mentioned it at all |
| **2.22.0 shipped without the Mac** — Xcode 27 turned a sub-12.0 macOS deployment target into a build error and the Catalyst build died at release time, with Android and iOS already built and every gate green | the Mac is the only platform built nowhere but a release, so a toolchain change that breaks it is invisible until the worst possible moment |
| **Five consecutive releases failed CI on GitHub**, 2.13.1 to 2.13.5 — every one of them for the same reason, and four failure mails arrived without anyone connecting them to the release that sent them | nothing; the cycle ran `jest` and `tsc` on the release machine and never once asked GitHub whether the same suite had passed there |

Both of the macOS entries above share a cause, and it is not a missing
check: **the release machine never installed the release.** It built the
artifact, inspected it, and stopped — while both failures only appear on a
Mac that *upgrades*. So the cycle now ends by installing what it just
published, with `brew upgrade`, and asserting the three things only a real
install can show: the version, a Gatekeeper-accepted stapled ticket, and a
widget extension registered without the app ever being launched.

The CI row has its own shape of cause. Local `jest` and `tsc` are not CI:
CI runs on a clean Linux checkout with a fresh install, none of this
machine's caches and none of its build artefacts, and it is the copy
everyone else reads to decide whether the tree is healthy. Nothing in the
cycle mentioned it existed, so a red `main` was invisible from inside the
only tool anyone ran — and a permanently red `main` teaches people to stop
opening CI at all, which costs more than the failure it is reporting. Two
gates now ask, and they deliberately ask different questions:

- **preflight** — the last *completed* `ci.yml` run on `main`. Not the
  newest, which is usually still in flight on the commit being released
  from; a gate that blocks for the length of every CI run is a gate people
  route around. A repo with no completed runs is a fresh clone, not a
  failure.
- **`verify-release.sh`** — the **tag's own commit**. `main` going green
  afterwards does not make the tag green, and the tag is what F-Droid
  builds from and what anyone bisecting checks out. Three outcomes, like
  the iOS check: green passes, red fails, and a run that has not finished
  prints `⧗` and holds the summary back, because release verification runs
  seconds after the push and "not finished" is not a verdict.
- **the last phase of the cut** — the same question, *waited for*.
  Verification runs seconds after the tag push, when the run does not
  exist yet, so on its own the second gate would never have had an answer
  during a cycle — which is exactly how five red releases went unremarked,
  reported only by a mail arriving later addressed to nobody. `ci.yml` is
  `jest` and `tsc` on ubuntu and everything irreversible is already done,
  so the cycle waits up to ten minutes for the verdict. A red one is a `⚠`
  and a non-zero exit, never a rollback: the tag is public and pushed tags
  are not moved here, so the recovery is forward and the preflight gate is
  what enforces it.

`v2.13.5` is the last tag that fails this check, and it cannot be fixed:
re-running a workflow re-runs the code at that commit, and pushed tags are
never moved here.

The script's one rule: **everything that can fail happens before anything
that cannot be undone.** Tests, the changelog limits, the Xcode Cloud
in-flight check, the signature and App Group of the *actual* zip about to
be published — all before the first `git push`. After that the order is
main → tag → GitHub release → tap, because each is only recoverable by
the one before it having already succeeded.

`--dry-run` stops at exactly that line, having done all the work and none
of the publishing.

### What it still cannot do for you

Two things need a human at a console, and the script prints both when it
finishes:

- **Play** — upload `app-play-release.aab`. The release notes for the new
  `versionCode` must already be in `fastlane/metadata/android/*/changelogs/`
  before you start; the script refuses to run without them.
- **App Store** — the release script already started the build, on the
  commit it tagged: it un-pauses the workflow, starts a run and pauses it
  again, all inside one step. Watch it with `./scripts/xcode-cloud.py runs
  3` and submit from App Store Connect once it succeeds.

  **Do not push to `main` until it finishes.** A second push cancels the
  run (the workflow sets `autoCancel`), and the build that reaches App
  Store Connect is then built from the newer commit rather than the tagged
  one — 2.13.1's own run #550 was cancelled this way, minutes after the
  tag.

  If the script reported that Apple would not start the run — `HTTP 500
  UNEXPECTED_ERROR` from `POST /v1/ciBuildRuns`, which is how App Store
  Connect says *rate limited* — nothing is building. Retry when it clears;
  it re-pauses itself either way:

  ```sh
  ./scripts/xcode-cloud.py resume && ./scripts/xcode-cloud.py start
  ./scripts/xcode-cloud.py pause
  ```

### The Mac needs its own Xcode

**Xcode 27 cannot build the Catalyst app.** It made a macOS deployment
target below 12.0 an error, and this project reports 10.15 from somewhere
no build setting reaches — every pod target, the app target and both
projects at 12.0, target *and* project level, plus
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0` on the xcodebuild command line, which
outranks all of them. 105 targets fail before anything compiles. The same
tree builds clean under Xcode 26.6, so it is the toolchain, not the
project. The cause is most likely podspec platform metadata upstream in
React Native; hermes-engine's prebuilt macOS framework declares 10.15 in
its own `Info.plist`.

So keep a second Xcode at **`/Applications/Xcode-26.app`**. Do not
`xcode-select` it — iOS and everything else should stay on the current
one. `build-catalyst.sh` finds it by itself: it uses the selected Xcode
when that is 26 or older, falls back to `/Applications/Xcode-26.app`, and
stops with instructions when neither works. `release.sh` asks the same
question in preflight, so a missing toolchain costs a second rather than
being found after the Android build.

Two knobs, both documented at the head of `build-catalyst.sh`:
`CATALYST_XCODE` moves the fallback path, and `CATALYST_DEVELOPER_DIR`
names a toolchain outright and skips the version check — which is also how
you retest a newer Xcode once upstream fixes this:

```sh
CATALYST_DEVELOPER_DIR="$(xcode-select -p)" ./scripts/build-catalyst.sh
```

When that starts working, raise `CATALYST_MAX_XCODE` or delete the block.

**If the Mac genuinely cannot be built**, a release can still ship the
other two: `SKIP_CATALYST=1 ./scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z` skips the build,
the zip as an asset and the cask bump together. The cask is deliberately
left pointing at the last version that *has* a zip — one naming a version
without one 404s on every `brew install` — and `verify-release.sh` will
fail its five Mac checks, which is correct rather than something to
silence. Ship the Mac afterwards by building the zip, `gh release upload`
it onto the existing tag, then bumping the cask's version and sha against
the *published* zip and pushing the tap.

For beta tags, swap the Gradle commands for `assembleFdroidBeta` /
`bundlePlayBeta` and mark the GitHub release as **prerelease** — the
script does production tags only.

## 2. F-Droid

F-Droid builds the APK themselves on their CI from a public tag. We don't ship a built APK to them — we ship a recipe and a git tag.

### Files

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `contrib/fdroid/com.prayer_times.yml` | **Local copy of the recipe**, source of truth in this repo. |
| `~/git/fdroiddata/metadata/com.prayer_times.yml` | **Upstream copy**, now merged into `fdroid/fdroiddata` master. |
| https://f-droid.org/packages/com.prayer_times/ | **The listing.** Live once F-Droid's builder has run against a tag. |
| `contrib/fdroid/README.md` | The submission-kit README. Outside contributors read this. |
| `contrib/fdroid/PRE_MERGE_CHECKLIST.md` | Local sanity checks before pushing. |
| `contrib/fdroid/MERGE_REQUEST.md` | Suggested MR title / description for GitLab. |

### Per-release flow

**Since the MR merged (1 Aug 2026) there is nothing to do per release.** The
recipe carries `AutoUpdateMode: Version` + `UpdateCheckMode: Tags`, so
F-Droid's own checkupdates bot adds each new version from the git tag. Two
consequences worth holding on to:

- **Do not delete or move a pushed tag.** The bot may already have written a
  build entry pointing at it, and F-Droid's build then fails on a missing ref.
- Only file an MR by hand if the *recipe* itself has to change — a new NDK, a
  new gradle prop, a new source dependency — not for a version bump.

The manual flow below is kept for that case, and for anyone forking this
setup from scratch.

1. Bump versions (step 1 of the shared flow).
2. Tag the release `v2.x.y` and push the tag. **The recipe references tag refs, not commit hashes** — F-Droid CI enforces this.
3. Edit `contrib/fdroid/com.prayer_times.yml`:
   - Add a new entry under `Builds:` with the new `versionName`, `versionCode`, and `commit: v2.x.y`.
   - Update the trailing `CurrentVersion:` and `CurrentVersionCode:`.
4. Mirror to the fork:
   ```sh
   cp contrib/fdroid/com.prayer_times.yml ~/git/fdroiddata/metadata/com.prayer_times.yml
   ```
5. Commit + push both repos:
   ```sh
   git -C ~/git/PrayerApp     add -A && git -C ~/git/PrayerApp     commit -m "fdroid metadata: bump to vX.Y.Z (versionCode N)"
   git -C ~/git/PrayerApp     push
   git -C ~/git/fdroiddata    add -A && git -C ~/git/fdroiddata    commit -m "com.prayer_times: bump to vX.Y.Z (versionCode N)"
   git -C ~/git/fdroiddata    push                       # to the fork, branch add-com.prayer_times
   ```
   The MR auto-updates the moment the fork branch advances.

### Local sanity build

```sh
./android/gradlew -p android assembleFdroidRelease
# → android/app/build/outputs/apk/fdroid/release/app-fdroid-release.apk
```

That APK is **not** what goes on GitHub Releases any more (it was, up to 2.25.0).

### The `github` flavor (GitHub Releases / Obtainium)

```sh
./android/gradlew -p android assembleGithubRelease -PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a
# → android/app/build/outputs/apk/github/release/app-github-release.apk
```

`release.sh` builds it and publishes it as `Mihrab-vX.Y.Z.apk`. It exists because the F-Droid APK is shaped by F-Droid's CI, not by phones: R8 off and all four ABIs made it 84 MB against Play's ~36 MB per device. The `github` flavor keeps R8 and resource shrinking on and packages `arm64-v8a` + `armeabi-v7a` only (`ndk.abiFilters`). Like every flavor it has no Google Play Services, Firebase or Play Core — `release.sh` checks the dex before publishing — and "Rate Mihrab" opens GitHub rather than the Play Store. Same applicationId and signing key as earlier GitHub APKs, so Obtainium installs update in place. Gradle refuses to build it (or play) in the same invocation as fdroid, and refuses to debug-sign it.

### What the `fdroid` flavor does differently

- **No billing dependency anywhere** — the tip jar and `react-native-iap` were removed from the project, so no flavor pulls one in.
- **No Google Play Services** — guarded by the `patch-package` patch on `@react-native-community/geolocation` that strips `play-services-location` and uses AOSP `LocationManager` only.
- **No ABI splits** — split APKs are only enabled for `playRelease` (guarded by `wantsPlayRelease` in `app/build.gradle`). The F-Droid build is a single universal APK, which is what their CI recipe expects.

### F-Droid CI rules (`rewritemeta` linter)

Mechanically enforced; ignore at your peril:

- Multi-line `curl` commands in `sudo:` MUST keep a **trailing space before the indented URL line**.
- Build entries MUST use **tag refs** (`commit: v2.1.0`), never commit hashes.
- One entry per `Builds:` block per target.
- The `Name:` field, if present, MUST appear AFTER `Changelog:` (we hit this in v2.0.13).

For known build pitfalls — Kotlin 2.2 SAM regressions, RemoteViews allowed-views, JDK 17 install via curl — see the agent memory file `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/.../memory/fdroid_ci_safeguards.md`.

## 3. Google Play

Manual upload to the Play Console after a local AAB build. No automation yet.

### Build

```sh
# Production AAB
./android/gradlew -p android bundlePlayRelease
# → android/app/build/outputs/bundle/playRelease/app-play-release.aab

# Beta AAB (separate channel, .beta applicationId suffix)
./android/gradlew -p android bundlePlayBeta
# → android/app/build/outputs/bundle/playBeta/app-play-beta.aab
```

### Signing

`android/keystore.properties` (gitignored). Required keys:

```properties
storeFile=mihrab-release.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=mihrab
keyPassword=...
```

The Gradle `wantsPlayRelease` guard in `app/build.gradle` REFUSES to fall back to debug signing for `playRelease` / `playBeta`. If `keystore.properties` is missing or incomplete, the build fails loudly rather than producing an unsigned-for-Play binary.

### Upload

1. Open https://play.google.com/console.
2. App: **Mihrab** (`com.prayer_times`).
3. Release → **Production** (or **Open testing** / **Internal testing** for staged rollouts).
4. **Create new release** → upload `app-play-release.aab`.
5. Paste the release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.
6. Roll out — typically Internal → Open → Production over a week.

### Listing copy

`fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/`:

```
fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/
├── title.txt
├── short_description.txt
├── full_description.txt
├── changelogs/
│   └── 149.txt           # one file per versionCode
└── images/
    ├── icon.png
    ├── featureGraphic.png
    └── phoneScreenshots/
```

The Play Console reads from these, and F-Droid copies the screenshot folders
into its own repo at build time — so what is on the F-Droid listing is
whatever these folders held at the tagged commit. They hold the same
captioned panels as Play (`branding/tools/build_store.py` writes both).

**F-Droid never deletes a screenshot it has copied.** fdroidserver copies
every file in `phoneScreenshots/` into `repo/com.prayer_times/en-US/` and
has no cleanup step, so a file renamed here becomes a *second* screenshot on
the listing, under the old name, until an F-Droid admin removes it by hand.
Overwrite in place; never rename. (Seen 2026-09-11: four July captures
under old names — `2_quran`, `3_duas`, `4_tasbih`, `5_fasting` — were still
on the listing beside the current seven.)

### Flavor specifics

- **`play` flavor**: Google Play Services for location. The `PrayerBuildInfo` native module still exposes the flavor to JS, now only so `rateApp` knows whether there is a Play Store to open.
- **ABI splits**: per-ABI APKs (`armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, `x86`, `x86_64`) for the Play upload, `universalApk = false`. Cuts download size ~3-4× per device.
- **R8 minification**: on (`enableProguardInReleaseBuilds = true`). Rules in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` — keep `com.prayer_times.**` and any new RN-bridged native modules.

---

## 4. App Store / TestFlight (iOS)

Normally via **Xcode Cloud**, which handles signing, archiving and upload.

**There is a local path too, and it is not a fallback of last resort:**
`./scripts/build-ios-appstore.sh` archives, exports a signed `.ipa`,
validates it and uploads through `altool` with the API key in
`~/.config/mihrab/asc.json`. `--no-upload` stops after validation.

It exists because Xcode Cloud is one service on one company's weather —
on 2026-09-11 `POST /v1/ciBuildRuns` answered HTTP 500 for an hour, with
nothing to fix and no way to ship — and because until that same day this
account had **no distribution certificate at all**: every App Store build
Mihrab had ever shipped was signed by a cloud-managed certificate held on
Apple's side. Building locally needs your own `Apple Distribution`
certificate in the login keychain (Xcode → Settings → Accounts → Manage
Certificates → + → Apple Distribution), and its private key is the
irreplaceable half — a `.cer` from the developer portal is only the
public one.

Know what it does not prove: a local export signs against provisioning
profiles already on the machine, which is exactly how builds 520-522
archived green here and failed in the cloud. The script's entitlement
gate reads what each embedded appex actually claims in the built archive
and refuses to export on the specific mismatch that cost those three
builds, but a green local run is still not a green cloud run.

### Workflows

Connected in Xcode → Settings → Accounts → Xcode Cloud. ONE workflow,
named **Default**, configured to start on branch changes to `main` — a tag
push has never started anything, whatever an older version of this page
said.

**It is ENABLED, and a release is the only thing pushed to `main`.**
Changed 2026-09-11. Work accumulates locally and goes up when a release
goes up, so "every push builds iOS" and "only a release builds iOS" are
the same sentence, and no arming or disarming happens around a release.

Two things make that safe, and both are worth checking before you rely
on it. The dataset crons push on their own schedule — the workflow's
start condition skips them with `DO_NOT_START_IF_ALL_FILES_MATCH` over
**`data` and `src/providers/data`**; the second directory was added the
same day, and without it the rule skipped nothing, because every bot
commit writes a seed file under `src/providers/data` as well as the
dataset under `data`. And `release.sh` no longer starts a run blindly:
`xcode-cloud.py ensure <sha>` waits for the push's own run and starts
one only if the trigger silently did not fire, because two concurrent
runs do not race — they both die.

`pause` and `resume` still exist for the day either of those stops
being true. The paragraph below describes that older arrangement:
`isEnabled` false on the workflow, so no push builds anything —
`scripts/release.sh` arms it for the few seconds it takes to start a run on
the commit it just tagged, then disarms it. The pause is a `trap`, so it
happens on every path out of the script, including an abort: an armed
trigger left behind is the failure this whole arrangement exists to
prevent.

By hand, if you ever need it:

```sh
./scripts/xcode-cloud.py resume   # pushes to main build again
./scripts/xcode-cloud.py start    # build now (refuses while paused)
./scripts/xcode-cloud.py pause    # back to silent
```

WHY IT WAS PAUSED, since a paused build system is the kind of thing that
looks like an accident. Every run posts its result to GitHub as a commit
status called `PrayerApp | Default`, and on a public repository every
status is public — there is no way to report it privately. A run that is
cancelled, rate-limited or red therefore leaves a red X on the commit for
anyone reading the repo, sitting next to five green GitHub Actions checks
and saying nothing true about the code. Runs #724–#728 were all
`COMPLETE/CANCELED`, so `main` wore an X it had not earned.

The cost was that iOS shipped only when someone ran `start`, and
`./scripts/xcode-cloud.py shipped X.Y.Z` reported the version as never
having reached App Store Connect until they did. Enabled, the trade runs
the other way: the release's own push starts the run, and the discipline
that keeps `main` clean of red X's is that nothing but a release is
pushed to it.

The same Xcode workspace builds both. There's no Fastlane lane, no `xcrun altool` upload — Xcode Cloud signs the build with the App Store Connect cert + provisioning profile, and runs the iOS Distribution upload itself.

### Local builds

Only used for verification / debugging. Open `ios/PrayerApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode and Run, or:

```sh
cd ios
xcodebuild -workspace PrayerApp.xcworkspace -scheme PrayerApp \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \
  -derivedDataPath build/sim -quiet build

xcrun simctl install booted build/sim/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/PrayerApp.app
xcrun simctl launch booted com.hassan.prayerapp
```

Local builds use "Sign to Run Locally" / "Personal Team" signing — they won't run on a real device without a paid Apple Developer account.

### Version bumps

Every `vX.Y.Z` tag must have a matching `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.pbxproj`. Xcode Cloud reads this directly when archiving; if the build number is the same as a previous TestFlight build, App Store Connect rejects the upload.

**This is why the Default workflow does not build data-only pushes.** The
dataset bot (`.github/workflows/ifis-dataset.yml`) commits refreshed prayer
times to `main` without touching app code, so the version is unchanged from
the release before it — and every one of those pushes started a nine-minute
archive that could only ever die at "Preparing build for App Store Connect
failed", a duplicate build number (build 517, 2026-08-17). The failure is
noise, but it is noise that looks exactly like a broken release.

The fix is a start condition, set on the workflow itself rather than in this
repo, so it is written down here instead:

```
Xcode Cloud → Default → Edit Workflow → Start Conditions → Branch Changes
  Files and Folders: Do not start if all files match → directory "data"
```

Equivalently, on `ciWorkflows/{id}`, `branchStartCondition.filesAndFoldersRule`
= `{mode: "DO_NOT_START_IF_ALL_FILES_MATCH", matchers: [{directory: "data"}]}`.
A push that touches app code still builds, including one that touches app code
AND data — the rule only skips pushes where *every* changed file is under
`data/`. Setting it back to `null` restores the old behaviour.

```sh
# Bump build N → N+1, marketing version X.Y.Z → X.Y.(Z+1)
sed -i '' \
  's/CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = N/CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = N+1/g;
   s/MARKETING_VERSION = X.Y.Z/MARKETING_VERSION = X.Y.(Z+1)/g' \
  ios/PrayerApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
```

### Widget Extension

`ios/PrayerWidgetExtension/` is an embedded extension target inside the same `.ipa`. Its deployment target is iOS 16 (matches WidgetKit + ActivityKit minimums).

The Widget Extension Bundle (`PrayerWidgetExtension.swift`) is a `WidgetBundle` containing:

1. `PrayerTimesHomeWidget` — the home-screen + Lock-Screen accessory widget.
2. `PrayerLiveActivityWidget` (iOS 16.1+) — the ActivityKit Live Activity (Lock Screen card + Dynamic Island compact / minimal / expanded).

`PrayerLiveActivityAttributes.swift` is a **dual-target member** (main app + widget extension) so ActivityKit's type-identity check passes when the app calls `Activity<…>.request(…)` and the widget renders via `ActivityConfiguration<…>`. The dual membership is set via direct `pbxproj` edits — see `outputs/pbxproj_add_liveactivity.py` for the editor that wires it up.

### TestFlight

Three tester pools, configured in App Store Connect → TestFlight:

- **Internal Testers** — Hassan only. Gets every build automatically.
- **Beta Testers** (external, public link) — opt-in via the public TestFlight link. Gets every `main` push.
- **Production Testers** (external, invite-only) — invited explicitly before each App Store submission.

### App Store submission

After Xcode Cloud finishes the **Release** workflow:

1. Open App Store Connect → Mihrab → iOS App → App Store tab.
2. Pick the new build (Xcode Cloud uploaded it automatically).
3. Fill in "What's new" (copy from `CHANGELOG.md`).
4. **Submit for Review**.
5. Apple review is typically 24–48 hours.

## 5. GitHub releases (sideload + binary archive)

Every tag gets a GitHub release with the F-Droid APK attached, so:

- Users on F-Droid have a fallback while F-Droid CI is building the upstream version.
- Obtainium users (Android power-user app updater) can subscribe to GitHub Releases and auto-pull every new APK.
- Reproducible-build verifiers can compare the GitHub-attached APK against the F-Droid-built APK byte-for-byte.

```sh
gh release create vX.Y.Z \
  --title "vX.Y.Z" \
  --notes "$(awk '/^## \[X.Y.Z\]/,/^## \[/' CHANGELOG.md | sed '$d')" \
  android/app/build/outputs/apk/fdroid/release/app-fdroid-release.apk
```

For beta tags, add `--prerelease`.

## 6. End-to-end release

`./scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z` — see §1.

There used to be a thirteen-step checklist here, kept in parallel with the
one in §1. Two copies of the same procedure is how a procedure goes wrong:
by the time it was replaced this one had no Catalyst build, no Homebrew
cask, no signing check and no release notes limit, and still asked for a
`CHANGELOG.md` heading and a `CLAUDE.md` line that nothing reads. Anyone
following it faithfully would have shipped a broken macOS build.

### Preparing the release notes

The only thing you must do by hand before running the script, because it
refuses to start without them:

```sh
CODE=$(( $(grep -o 'versionCode [0-9]*' android/app/build.gradle | head -1 | awk '{print $2}') + 1 ))
for l in en-US sv-SE ar; do
  $EDITOR "fastlane/metadata/android/$l/changelogs/$CODE.txt"
done
```

Under 500 **characters** each — `wc -m`, not `wc -c`; Arabic and Swedish
are well under the limit in characters and can be over it in bytes.

These three files are also what the app itself shows. The "What's new"
sheet that opens on the first launch after an update, and again from
Settings → About, is built from every `changelogs/<code>.txt` there is —
joined to the version name and the tag date in
`src/polish/releaseNotes.generated.ts`, which `release.sh` rebuilds after
stamping the version and commits with the release. The other ten
languages fall back to the English note; add a `changelogs/` folder under
a locale and the app picks it up. Write for the reader, not the reviewer:
the CHANGELOG.md entry can say what was wrong and why, the note should
say what is different now. Bullets (`•`) and plain paragraphs are the
whole format; `**bold**` is honoured if you ever want a lead-in.

### If something fails partway

- **Before the "Publishing" step** — nothing has left your machine. The
  version bump is in the working tree; `git checkout --` the four stamped
  files and start again.
- **After `main` is pushed but before the tag** — safe to rerun once the
  cause is fixed; the script refuses a tag that already exists rather than
  moving one.
- **After the tag** — do not retag. Fix forward with the next patch
  version. Retagging silently converts the GitHub release to a draft and
  every asset URL starts 404ing, which breaks `brew install` (v2.7.39).

## 7. Where the credentials live

| What | Where | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Android upload key | `android/keystore.properties` (gitignored, in 1Password) | `./gradlew bundlePlayRelease` |
| App Store Connect API key | App Store Connect → Users + Access | Xcode Cloud (configured once in App Store Connect) |
| Apple Developer signing certs | Xcode → Settings → Accounts | Xcode Cloud (automatic) |
| GitHub PAT for `gh release` | `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` | `gh release create` |
| GitLab PAT for fdroiddata fork pushes | `~/.gitlab-credentials` | `git push origin add-com.prayer_times` (in `~/git/fdroiddata`) |

Nothing sensitive is in this repo; every credential is loaded from gitignored files or from the system keychain.
