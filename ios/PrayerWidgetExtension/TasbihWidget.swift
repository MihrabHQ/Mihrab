// Tasbih — the best possible fit for an interactive widget.
//
// One target, one number, no navigation. Count on the left, controls on the
// right; grown to systemMedium because three 20pt tap targets do not fit in a
// small and a control you have to aim at is not a control.
//
// THE QUEUE IS AN ORDERED LOG, not a set. Tapping Fajr twice on Log Today
// means Fajr; tapping +1 twice here means two. So the rules differ from that
// widget's in one way that matters: nothing is de-duplicated and order is the
// answer. `+1 +1 next +1` is two beads on one dhikr and one on the next.
//
// Rules mirrored from `src/widget/widgetTasbihQueue.ts`, whose tests decide
// what they are. Two behaviours are worth naming because they are easy to get
// wrong and invisible when you do:
//
//   • a bounded preset stops at its target. The preset's own
//     `unboundedAfterTarget` says which are which, and the payload carries it.
//   • Next keeps a part-finished count. Moving on must not discard it — that
//     is what the screen does, and a widget quietly throwing away 27 beads is
//     the worse surprise.
