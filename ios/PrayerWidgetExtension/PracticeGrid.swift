// The practice grid, as a widget can draw it.
//
// The in-app heatmap encodes six things on an 18pt square — fill depth,
// fasting, sunnah, missed, qiyam, selection — which needed a two-row legend
// to read. The widget carries FOUR: fill depth for the prayers, an outer
// amber ring for a completed fast, an inset gold line for how much sunnah
// the day held, and a grey corner dot for a day inside the record that was
// never filled in. The qiyam mark and the selection are left behind — a
// home screen has no legend and no tap, and a mark nobody can decode is
// noise.
//
// The ramp is the app's own — alpha = 0.42 + 0.58 × (kept/5) on the accent
// — so the widget and the Log screen describe the same week the same way.
// A widget that used its own scale would quietly disagree with the app.
