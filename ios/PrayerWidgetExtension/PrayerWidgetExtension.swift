// ── WHY EVERY LABEL BELOW IS RESOLVED HERE AND NOT BY SwiftUI ─────────
//
// `Text("widget_next_label")` is the obvious spelling and it was costing
// more than everything else this extension does put together.
//
// Measured 2026-08-30 on the shipped 2.13.6 build, launching the app to
// force one refresh: the extension burned 10.46s of CPU in 13 seconds,
// against 0.00s over 10s idle. WidgetKit kills an extension that holds
// 80% for 20 seconds, so a single ordinary refresh sat at four fifths of
// the way to being killed — and a second render inside that window, which
// is all a button press is, finished the job. That is the blank widget,
// and repeated, the widget that disappears. Five CPU-kill reports on this
// machine, spanning 2.10.1 to 2.13.6, all the same stack.
//
// `sample` on the extension mid-burn: 4004 of 4262 samples in
//
//   renderUntilStable → AccessibilityNodeAttachment.init
//     → AccessibilityText.init → Text.resolveAttributedString
//       → LocalizedStringKey.resolve
//         → -[NSBundle localizedAttributedStringForKey:value:table:localization:]
//           → _copyStringTable → _loadStringsFromData → parse 13 KB of plist
//
// Note the `localization:` on that selector. Every widget here sets
// `.environment(\.locale, mihrabLocale())` so labels follow MIHRAB's
// language rather than the system's — right for someone whose phone is in
// English and app in Arabic, and the reason the setting exists. But a
// locale that differs from the bundle's own pushes SwiftUI off NSBundle's
// cached lookup onto the localization-qualified one, which re-reads and
// re-parses the .strings file. Per label. Per render pass — and
// `renderUntilStable` renders until the output stops changing. Then again
// to build each accessibility label, which is the caller in that stack.
//
// So: resolve once, hand SwiftUI a String, and there is nothing left for
// it to look up. `widgetString` goes through `localizedString(forKey:...)`,
// which IS the cached path, and the memo below means even that happens
// once per key per process. The language behaviour is unchanged — same
// bundle, same tag — only the price is.
//
// The rule this earns: in a widget, `Text("literal")` is a filesystem
// read, not a constant.

/// Resolved strings, keyed by localization tag and key.
///
/// Providers run off the main thread and views run on it, so this really
/// is shared. A lock around a dictionary is the cheap side of the trade by
/// several orders of magnitude — the alternative is the plist parse above.
///
/// Keyed by tag, not just key, because the app's language can change while
/// this process is still alive and a memo that ignored that would keep
/// serving the old language until the extension happened to be relaunched.

  /// side of the app, and a widget extension has neither the key nor a
