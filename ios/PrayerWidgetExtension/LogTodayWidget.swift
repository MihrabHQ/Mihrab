// Log Today — the widget that changes what the app is on a home screen.
//
// Five targets, one per prayer. Tap Dhuhr and it is logged: no launch, no
// navigation. Prayers whose time has not come are not offered, which is the
// same rule the sunnah rows already follow in-app.
//
// ONE TAP MEANS "ON TIME". In the app a prayer can be on time, late, missed
// or made up; a single tap can only mean one of those, and on time is the
// overwhelmingly common case. The widget is a shortcut, not a replacement —
// anything else is a tap into the app.
//
// A TAP MUST BE REVERSIBLE. Tapping a filled cell within a minute clears it.
// Without that the widget is a trap: a mis-tap would put a status on a day
// that the user then has to go and find.
//
// iOS 17 is where Button(intent:) exists. On 16 the buttons are not drawn at
// all — a row of controls that silently do nothing is worse than a card that
// says what it is — and the whole widget deep-links into the Log instead.
