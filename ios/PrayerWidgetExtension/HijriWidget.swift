// Hijri date is the one thing in this app people look up rather than read,
// and it was previously only available by opening Home.
//
// A SEPARATE KIND rather than another family of the prayer-times widget,
// because someone who wants the date on their home screen does not
// necessarily want a prayer table there too, and WidgetKit's unit of choice
// is the kind.
//
// The date comes from the payload rather than being computed here. There is
// a tabular Umm al-Qura conversion in the app (`hijri/convert.ts`) and
// duplicating it in Swift would mean two implementations that can disagree
// about which day it is — and disagreeing about the date is the only way
// this widget can be wrong.
