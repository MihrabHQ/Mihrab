// Taps on the Log Today widget, waiting for the app to write them.
//
// The journal is an encrypted blob whose key lives on the JS side, so a
// widget extension cannot write it — and should not want to. `logPrayerOnTime`
// in `prayerLogAction.ts` already owns that write, including the rule that an
// existing status is never overwritten, and a second implementation of that
// rule in Swift is one that can drift from the first.
//
// So a tap lands here, in the same App Group defaults the payload already
// uses, and the app drains it through the real writer when it next runs. The
// widget renders this queue over the payload, so the tick appears on the tap
// rather than on the next launch.
//
// THE RULES BELOW MUST MATCH `src/widget/widgetLogQueue.ts` AND
// `WidgetLogQueue.kt`. That TypeScript file's tests are what say what the
// rules are; these are the second and third implementations of a three-case
// rule, and the only defence against the three disagreeing is that the cases
// are few enough to state in one place each.

/// WHY THIS FILE LOGS AT ALL.
///
/// On 2026-08-29 a user reported that tapping a prayer on the Mac widget did
/// nothing, and tapping it twice — the obvious thing to do when a button
/// appears dead — silently took the log back, because a second tap inside the
/// undo window is the undo. Reading the App Group afterwards showed why: the
/// `widget_log_queue` key was not there, and neither was any other key this
/// extension had ever written. The container held six keys and the app had
/// written all six. Every write from this process had been dropped.
///
/// Nothing could say more than that, because the extension emitted NOTHING to
/// the unified log — 20 minutes of taps produced zero lines — so from outside
/// there was no way to tell a failed write from an intent that never ran.
/// `tap()` has always returned whether the write reads back, and the comment
/// under it said in as many words that nothing acts on the result. That is the
/// bug behind the bug: the one process that knew was the one staying quiet.
///
/// ── AND WHY THESE ARE `notice`, NOT `info` (2026-09-01) ───────────────
///
/// The lines added on 2026-08-29 were `.info`, which was the second way to
/// lose the same evidence. `Logger.info` goes to the MEMORY store, and
/// `log show` does not display it without `--info` — so an investigator who
/// runs the obvious query
///
///   log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.hassan.prayerapp.widget"'
///
/// sees an empty table and concludes the code never ran. That is exactly
/// what happened here: chronod's own log shows `LogPrayerIntent.perform()`
/// invoked and finished at 18:04:29 on 2026-08-31, in this extension's
/// process, while our subsystem appeared to have said nothing at all.
///
/// `.notice` is the lowest level the unified log PERSISTS by default. These
/// lines are written a handful of times a day, by a button, about whether
/// someone's worship was recorded. That is worth a persisted line. If the
/// volume ever becomes a problem, the fix is a signpost profile, not a
/// quieter level.
let widgetLogLog = Logger(subsystem: "com.hassan.prayerapp.widget", category: "logqueue")

/// The Darwin notification that tells the app a widget queue has changed.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS. The queue drains on exactly two events — the app
/// mounting, and `AppState` going `active` — and a widget tap is neither.
/// On iPhone that is invisible: you cannot see a Home Screen widget while
/// the app is in front of you, so a tap always happens with the app in the
/// background, and opening it afterwards fires `active`. On a Mac,
/// Notification Center opens OVER an app that stays active, which is the
/// normal way to use the widget and therefore the normal way to strand a
/// tap. Measured 2026-08-29: two taps sat in the queue with the app open
/// the whole time, and only a relaunch wrote them.
///
/// That is worse than a delay. `MAX_QUEUE_AGE_MS` discards entries after a
/// fortnight, on the reasoning that a queue undrained for two weeks means
/// the app has not been opened for two weeks — an assumption that is simply
/// false on macOS, where the app can be open throughout. Left alone, a
/// fortnight of prayers logged from the widget would be dropped while the
/// widget showed the ticks the entire time.
///
/// A Darwin notification is the documented channel between an extension and
/// its container app, and it is the only one available here: the extension
/// cannot write the journal, and the app cannot observe another process's
/// UserDefaults reliably. It carries no payload — it only says "look again",
/// and the app re-reads the queue through the same drain it already had.
