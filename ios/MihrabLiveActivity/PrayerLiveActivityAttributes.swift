// Shared ActivityAttributes — task #128.
//
// Defines the wire format between the React Native side (which packs a
// JSON payload via `setContentState`) and the SwiftUI Live Activity
// widget (which renders it). The file is a member of BOTH targets:
//   • PrayerApp (main app) — uses ActivityKit's Activity<…>.request /
//     update / end to drive the Activity from the JS bridge.
//   • MihrabLiveActivity (the Live Activity extension) — declares
//     ActivityConfiguration<…> in PrayerLiveActivityWidget.swift so the OS
//     knows how to render.
// Both targets must see the SAME type identity, hence the dual
// membership recorded in PrayerApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj.
//
// Decoding strategy: the JS side serialises a flat object whose keys
// match the property names below. We use the synthesised `Codable`
// conformance so a small JS-side payload change doesn't require a
// hand-written init.

/**
 A DEFAULT IS NOT A FALLBACK UNLESS YOU WRITE ONE.

 Five properties across these two structs say "Defaults to X so older
 payloads still decode". They did not. Synthesized `Decodable` ignores a
 property's default and throws `keyNotFound` — the same trap already
 spelled out on `extraRows` and on `tinted`, which is why both of those
 are Optional. The rest were left as defaulted non-Optionals, and one of
 them broke the feature outright:

 `Row.display` is the clock-format string, and the payload builder only
 emits one when it differs from `time`. On a 24-hour clock the JS side
 sent no `display`, `JSON.stringify` dropped the key, this decoder threw
 on every payload, and `start` rejected into a caught promise — so NO
 Live Activity was ever created, silently, for anyone reading a 24-hour
 clock. The sender now always writes the key; these initialisers make
 its absence survivable anyway, which is what the comments promised.

 Required fields stay required. Without a next prayer there is nothing
 to draw, and failing loudly is the right answer there.

 Written in extensions so the memberwise initialisers survive for
 previews and tests.
