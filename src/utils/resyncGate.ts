/**
 * "Has anything actually changed since the last time we did this?" — v2.10.2.
 *
 * Every foreground used to cost the same as a cold start: a GPS fix, a
 * network fetch, a teardown and rewrite of ~48 OS alarms, a full decrypt of
 * the journal, two widget payload writes and a Live Activity restart. And
 * `'active'` does not mean "the user came back" — it fires when a share sheet
 * closes, when a permission dialog dismisses, when the screen unlocks.
 * `autoSync.ts` has said so in a comment for months ("several times a minute
 * in normal use") and was the only path that throttled on it.
 *
 * ── WHY A FINGERPRINT AND NOT JUST A TIMER ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A pure time gate is the obvious fix and it is the wrong one. The whole
 * reason to resync on foreground is that the answer may have changed: a day
 * rolled over, a plane landed in another timezone, the user changed their
 * calculation method. Suppress those for N seconds and the app shows the
 * wrong prayer times, which is the one thing it may never do.
 *
 * So a change always wins. The timer only decides how often to re-do work
 * whose inputs are IDENTICAL — which is the only case where skipping is free.
 *
 * The gap is deliberately short. It exists to swallow the burst of `'active'`
 * events that one user action produces, not to defer real refreshes: anyone
 * who has been away long enough for the world to move has been away for
 * longer than this.
