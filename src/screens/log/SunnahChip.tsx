/**
 * The sunnah control, in the prayer's header rather than beside its statuses.
 *
 * IT USED TO SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE FROM ITS OWN ROW. The four status
 * chips are a radio group: flat pills, one of them filled. Sitting at the end
 * of that row, behind a hairline divider, was a bordered tile with pips and
 * small-caps text — a stepper. Two control grammars, side by side, five times
 * down the page, and the row read as "controls" rather than as a prayer. It
 * also stole 62pt, which is why the statuses had to be abbreviated to "Miss"
 * and "Qad" — words that exist in no language the app ships in.
 *
 * Moving it up to sit with the time solves both at once: the status row
 * becomes one radio group and nothing else, and the chips get the width to
 * say what they mean. The sunnah is a different KIND of fact from the fard —
 * a count, not a choice — so it belongs beside the other fact in that header
 * (the time), not among the choices.
 *
 * ASR SIMPLY HAS NO CHIP. The old tile stayed and said "None", which is a
 * control whose whole content is an explanation of why it does nothing. Every
 * other row carrying a gold chip makes Asr's silence self-explanatory, and a
 * screen reader is told the same by the row's own label rather than by an
 * unlabelled dead button.
