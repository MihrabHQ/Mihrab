/**
 * Quran preferences — the app-wide companion-text choice (v2.7.40), and
 * whether a surah has one reader or two.
 *
 * ── UNDER EACH VERSE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One control for what renders beneath each ayah everywhere: the mode
 * (translation ⇄ tafsir) and the edition for that mode. Backed by the same
 * persisted stores as the pickers on the Quran page and in the reader
 * (`quranState.prefs.companionMode` / `tafsirEditionId`,
 * `settings.quranTranslationEdition`), so every entry point stays in sync.
 *
 * Shown as a one-line summary row that opens the same bottom sheet the
 * Quran page uses (task #97). It used to render the whole picker inline —
 * both mode segments plus every translation AND tafsir edition, grouped by
 * language — which was several screens of scrolling in the middle of
 * Settings for a choice most people make once.
 *
 * ── READING A SURAH ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The muṣḥaf is the reader. The verse-by-verse list is the other one,
 * and this is the only place it can be asked for — `QuranSurahScreen`
 * reads `settings.quranVerseByVerseEnabled` and the muṣḥaf header shows
 * the switch between them only while it is on.
