/**
 * Settings → Appearance. Theme, accent, time format, language, and on
 * Android the home-screen widget.
 *
 * Language sits here rather than on a page of its own because it is a
 * decision about how the app LOOKS to you, and a settings index with a
 * one-row page in it is an index that made you tap twice for nothing.
 *
 * The widget arrived by that same rule. It had a section of its own back
 * when it owned a colour picker as well; #127 unified that picker with
 * the app accent and left a page with one slider on it — a destination,
 * an icon and a tap for a single control. It is a look-and-feel choice
 * and the accent it follows is picked two cards above it, so this is
 * where it belongs. `WidgetCard` draws nothing off Android, so nothing
 * about this page changes there.
