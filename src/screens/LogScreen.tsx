/**
 * The Log — prayers and fasting on one screen (design review 2c).
 *
 * They were two screens with two visual languages recording the same act:
 * what you did today. Merged, they share one graph — green depth for
 * prayers, an amber ring for the fast — and one day column. The stats
 * trio and the two "all logged days" lists are gone: the graph already
 * shows the streak, so the number only has to name it, and a wall of
 * squares says more than a scrolling list of dates ever did.
 *
 * Everything either screen could DO is still here: the four statuses, the
 * private note per prayer, marking and unmarking a fast, the day-before
 * reminder and the sunnah calendar (behind "All upcoming", since a calendar
 * is reference, not a daily action).
 *
 * THE SCREEN SHOWS A DAY, not today. It used to be welded to `dayKey()`,
 * which meant the journal could only ever be written forward: a prayer you
 * forgot to mark last night was unreachable the next morning, and a record
 * you cannot correct is one you stop trusting. Any day back to the first
 * one you ever logged can be opened — with the arrows, or by tapping its
 * square in the graph — and every control on the screen writes to whichever
 * day is open. Forward stops at today, because a log of the future is a
 * plan, and this screen is not for plans.
