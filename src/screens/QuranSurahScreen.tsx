/**
 * The surah route — one route, one reader, or two if asked.
 *
 * The muṣḥaf is the reader. `settings.quranVerseByVerseEnabled` says
 * whether the ayah-by-ayah list is offered beside it at all, and only
 * then does `settings.quranReadingMode` say which of the two is on
 * screen and does the header of each carry the toggle to the other.
 * This screen hydrates what both need, finds the surah, and renders one
 * of them; everything either reader knows about the navigator — header
 * controls, orientation, fullscreen, content colour, the Mac's back
 * gesture — lives with that reader.
 *
 * It used to be all one component, 980 lines switching on `isMushaf` in
 * a shared header effect, content style, sheet guard and render. Each
 * muṣḥaf concern was a branch inside something the translation reader also
 * ran, and each platform edge case landed here as another one.
