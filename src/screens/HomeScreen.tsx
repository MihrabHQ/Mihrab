/**
 * HomeScreen orchestrator — task #8 split.
 *
 * Owns hooks, effects, and orchestration; delegates rendering to children
 * under `src/screens/home/`. Two big perf wins land here:
 *
 *  1. The 30-second clock tick lives inside `TodayCard`'s hero (the only
 *     component that displays the countdown). Previously the tick triggered
 *     `setNow(...)` in this file, forcing an 800-line tree to re-render every
 *     30 seconds. Now only the countdown re-renders — not even the day strip
 *     or the eight prayer rows beside it.
 *
 *  2. `nextInfo` (the next prayer's name + Date) is recomputed only when a
 *     prayer actually passes — not every tick. The local "watchdog" effect
 *     polls every 30s but only calls `setNextInfo(...)` when the result has
 *     genuinely changed, so the day table re-renders only when the
 *     highlighted row should move.
 *
 * Anything else this file does (notification sync, widget sync, last-fetched
 * coord persistence, locale-aware day labels) is unchanged behavior — same
 * effects, same call shapes, just lifted out of the rendering hot path.
