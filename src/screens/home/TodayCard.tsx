/**
 * Home's single "today" card (design review 2a).
 *
 * Replaces four floating slabs — hero, day table, carousel dots, month link —
 * with one object, in the order a person actually reads it:
 *
 *   how long have I got  →  which day am I looking at  →  the times
 *
 * That ordering is the whole point of the change. The old hero answered the
 * wrong question (64pt "12:59", a 14pt "in 3h 24m" pill) and then the table
 * repeated the same prayer one row down; the day switcher was six 6-px dots
 * wedged between two cards, which nobody swipes because they cannot see its
 * edge.
 *
 * The hero adapts rather than lies: a countdown only means something for
 * today, so on any other day that slot becomes the date, the hijri date and
 * the day's first prayer — same position, honest content. For the same
 * reason the next-prayer highlight and its rail appear only on today; on
 * Saturday nothing is next, so nothing is emphasised.
 *
 * Both gestures drive one selection: tap a chip, or swipe the card body the
 * way the carousel used to work.
