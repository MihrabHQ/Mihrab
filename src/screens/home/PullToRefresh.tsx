/**
 * PULL THE HOME PAGE DOWN TO REFRESH ITS TIMES.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT `RefreshControl` ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because of what this refresh is. It is not "fetch the current value" —
 * it re-downloads a published table, drops a month of stored rows and
 * refills them (`refreshStoredPrayerData`), and on a slow connection that
 * is tens of seconds with a number attached. `RefreshControl` offers a
 * spinner and no way to say how far along it is, and a spinner that sits
 * for half a minute is indistinguishable from one that has hung. So the
 * indicator says what stage the gesture is at on the way down, and how far
 * the work has got once it is running.
 *
 * ── WHY IT WAS LAGGY, AND WHAT CHANGED ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first version drove the pull from a `PanResponder`: every touch
 * event went to the JavaScript thread, which worked out a distance and
 * pushed it back to the page with `setValue`. The page could only move as
 * fast as that round trip, and the Home page's JavaScript thread is not
 * idle — the countdown ticks every second, and the pull ALSO called a
 * state setter on every move from a hook living in HomeScreen, so a
 * fifteen-hundred-line screen was being asked to render while the reader's
 * thumb was on it. Reported as "very laggy", correctly.
 *
 * Now the finger moves the page on the UI thread. `PanGestureHandler`
 * feeds its translation straight into a native-driven `Animated.event`,
 * and the page's transform is an `interpolate` of that value over
 * `PULL_CURVE` — no JavaScript between the finger and the pixels. The
 * house precedent is `ShareMonthScreen`'s pinch, which has moved a month
 * table this way for as long as it has existed.
 *
 * JavaScript still hears about the pull, through the event's listener,
 * for the two things that are decisions rather than motion: which words
 * the indicator shows, and whether a release refreshes. Those updates go
 * to a small store the indicator subscribes to — never to HomeScreen,
 * which renders nothing at all while a pull is in progress.
 *
 * ── HOW IT SHARES THE PAGE WITH THE SCROLL VIEW ───────────────────────
 *
 * The handler is enabled only while the page is at the top, and the
 * scroll view WAITS for it (`waitFor`): a drag that turns out to be a pull
 * never starts a scroll, and one that turns out to be anything else —
 * upward, or sideways across the day carousel — fails the pull within a
 * few points and goes on as a scroll. See `pullGesture.ts` for the
 * offsets and why each one is there.
 *
 * ── AND NOT ON THE MAC ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A pull is a thumb. On Catalyst the page is driven by a trackpad and a
 * scroll wheel, where an overscroll is not a gesture anybody makes on
 * purpose, and the same refresh is a row in Settings.
