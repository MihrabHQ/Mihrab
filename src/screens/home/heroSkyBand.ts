/**
 * The hero's sky, published for the one view that is NOT inside it: the
 * band behind the system status bar.
 *
 * ── WHY THE BAND NEEDS THIS ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On the phone the sky runs up under the status bar, which is the point of
 * it — the clock and the battery sit on the night or the dawn rather than
 * on a grey strip. At rest that is right. Scroll, though, and the hero's
 * own top row rides up into that strip: the city and the Qibla bearing
 * were drawn straight through the clock and the status icons, both
 * illegible (reported on a Pixel 10 Pro).
 *
 * So the strip stops being clear as soon as anything would pass behind it.
 * The band that covers it cannot be a colour of its own, or it would read
 * as a slab laid over the sky; it has to BE the sky at that height. That
 * is what this store carries: the gradient's two ends and the height it is
 * drawn over, from which the band mixes the exact colour of the pixel
 * directly beneath its lower edge — so the seam between band and sky is
 * not a seam at all, and the row simply disappears behind it.
 *
 * A module store rather than a prop or a context, for the reason
 * `tabBarVisibility` gives: the publisher (the hero) re-renders on the
 * countdown's tick, and the consumer is a view at the root of the screen
 * that must not re-render with it.
