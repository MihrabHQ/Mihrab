/**
 * The strip behind the system status bar, on the phone's Today screen.
 *
 * AT REST IT IS NOT THERE. The sky runs up under the clock and the battery
 * and that is the design: a hero that stops at the status bar is a card,
 * not a sky. The strip appears the moment the page moves, because the
 * hero's own top row — the city, the Qibla bearing — rides up into it and
 * was being drawn straight through the system's glyphs.
 *
 * ITS COLOUR IS THE SKY'S OWN, at the height its lower edge sits at. The
 * gradient is linear over `skyH`, so the colour under the band's foot at
 * scroll `s` is `skyColorAt((s + insetTop) / skyH)` — and because that is
 * linear in `s` too, two interpolation stops describe it exactly rather
 * than approximately: at rest, and at the scroll where the band's foot
 * reaches the sky's. Matching the pixel BELOW the band (not above it) is
 * what makes the join invisible: the band's own top edge is the edge of
 * the screen, where nothing can be compared to it.
 *
 * Past the hero there is no sky left to match, so it hands over to the
 * page's own colour across a short crossfade — the hero's foot is
 * sliding past the strip exactly then, and the two read as one movement.
 * The status bar's glyphs go with it: they take their ink from the sky
 * while the sky is up there (the hero sets that, from the same model), and
 * from the page once the page is what they sit on. Without that, a night
 * sky in a light app left white glyphs on a white strip.
