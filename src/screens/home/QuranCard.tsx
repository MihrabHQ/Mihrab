/**
 * Home's Quran card (design review 2b) — the doors back into the book.
 *
 * It never disappears: the khatmah's next page, the reading marker, both
 * when the reader keeps both (#41), or the way in when nothing has been
 * started. Which doors are drawn is `selectQuranCardState`'s decision and
 * the rows themselves are `ResumeDoors`, shared with the Qur'an tab, so
 * this file is the shell and nothing else.
 *
 * It no longer reads a verse. The ayah of the day was drawn here when
 * nothing had been started, and a card that is sometimes a shortcut and
 * sometimes a passage of scripture was two things on one spot; Today is
 * the times, and this is the door. The verse keeps its notification.
 *
 * Low, and one row per door: an icon, a line, a line under it, a bar when
 * there is a plan. It sits under a table that fills the screen, and every
 * point of height here is a point the hero gives up — which is why a
 * second door is a second row in the same card and not a second card.
