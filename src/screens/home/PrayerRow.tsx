   * digit wider than "5:36 AM", so one row's bell sat a digit to the left
   * of the other six. The card knows all the times, so it picks the
   * longest and hands the same string to every row.
   *
   * ── LONGEST IS NOT ALWAYS WIDEST ──────────────────────────────────
   *
   * The card compares string LENGTHS, which stands in for width only
   * while the numerals are tabular. `tabularNumeralStyle` asks for that,
   * but `fontVariant: ['tabular-nums']` is a request to the font, not a
   * guarantee: Android lets people choose a system font, and a
   * decorative one often ships no `tnum` table. The request then does
   * nothing, digits go back to their natural widths, and two times of
   * equal length no longer render equally wide.
   *
   * That is issue #26. On a handwriting system font the column was sized
   * by "00:46" and had to hold "02:23", which is wider in that face — so
   * the clock wrapped onto a second line mid-value ("02:2" / "3"), and
   * only on the rows whose digits happened to be the wide ones.
   *
   * So the sample is used only when it is genuinely longer than this
   * row's own time. At equal length the row sizes to its own time, which
   * is correct in any font. With tabular numerals every row's own time is
   * the same width and the column stays aligned exactly as before; with a
   * font that ignores the request, a row may sit a few pixels out of line
   * with its neighbours — which is the right thing to lose, because the
   * alternative is a prayer time broken across two lines.
