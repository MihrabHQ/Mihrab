/**
 * Where the moon is in its month, and which way up it looks from here.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE, AND WHY IT WAS NOT ENOUGH ───────────────────
 *
 * The hero used to take the phase from a straight line: a fixed new moon
 * in January 2000 plus whole multiples of the mean synodic month, 29.53
 * days. That is a linear model of a cycle that is not linear. The moon's
 * orbit is eccentric, so it runs ahead of the mean near perigee and
 * behind it near apogee, and the real interval between new moons swings
 * between about 29.27 and 29.83 days.
 *
 * Measured against the elongation this file now computes, over three
 * years of nights, the old model was out by up to 23 HOURS of lunar age,
 * and the eight-way phase it picked disagreed on 106 of 1096 nights —
 * one night in ten. On 2026-03-16 it drew a new moon, which is very
 * nearly nothing at all, when the real moon was a waning crescent.
 *
 * ── WHAT REPLACES IT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The phase is the elongation: the moon's apparent ecliptic longitude
 * minus the sun's, which is the angle the two make as seen from here and
 * therefore exactly what "how much of it is lit" means. Zero is new,
 * half a turn is full.
 *
 * The positions come from the standard truncated series — Kepler for
 * each body, then the named periodic terms for the moon (evection, the
 * variation, the yearly equation, and the rest of the first dozen). That
 * is good to roughly 0.2°, or about twenty minutes of lunar age, which
 * is four orders of magnitude inside the error it replaces and far below
 * anything a 22dp disc can show. Checked against published phase
 * instants in the tests.
 *
 * ── AND WHICH WAY UP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the part that needs the reader's own coordinates, and the part
 * the old drawing simply asserted: "as seen from the northern
 * hemisphere: waxing lights the right limb".
 *
 * Half the world does not see that. The lit side of the moon faces the
 * sun, and where the sun sits relative to the moon IN YOUR SKY depends
 * on where you are standing. A first-quarter moon on the meridian is lit
 * on the right in Stockholm and on the left in Cape Town, because the
 * southern observer is facing north to see it and west has moved to the
 * other hand. On the equator a young crescent after sunset sits with the
 * sun directly below it and lies on its back like a bowl — the shape
 * that gets called a smile, and the shape a great many of this app's
 * readers actually see.
 *
 * So the disc is drawn once, lit on the right, and rotated. Two angles
 * decide by how much:
 *
 *   χ  the position angle of the bright limb, from celestial north —
 *      where the sun is relative to the moon on the sky itself, the same
 *      for everyone.
 *   q  the parallactic angle — the angle between celestial north and
 *      the observer's own up, which is where standing somewhere comes
 *      in, and the only reason the crescent flips between hemispheres.
 *
 * `q - χ` is the bright limb measured clockwise from straight up in the
 * reader's sky, and the drawing starts with it at 90° (pointing right),
 * so the rotation is `q - χ - 90`. Waxing and waning stop being separate
 * cases: waning is just a rotation of about half a turn, which is what it
 * is.
