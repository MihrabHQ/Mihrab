/**
 * The surah read with its translation (or tafsir) under each āyah — a
 * virtualized list, one card per āyah (docs/quran-reader-plan.md,
 * QR-1/2/17/20).
 *
 *   • VIRTUALIZED: Al-Baqarah does not mount 286 cards at once (QR-1).
 *   • Arabic renders word-by-word so recitation can highlight the live
 *     word (QR-17); memorization hide/reveal masks Arabic or translation
 *     per āyah (QR-20).
 *   • Translation text loads asynchronously after first paint (QR-2) — the
 *     1–2 MB edition JSON no longer blocks the navigation transition.
 *
 * This and the muṣḥaf were one screen until 2 September, switching on
 * `isMushaf` in a shared header effect, content style and render. They
 * share a route and a toggle; `QuranSurahScreen` is the route now, and this
 * is the translation reader on its own.

       * arrow means drawing the arrow. `TabBackButton` is the app's own,
       * already matched to the navigator's glyph and inset for exactly
       * this reason (a tab's header has no back control either), and it
       * takes an `onPress`, so here it pops instead of going to Today.
       * The swipe-back gesture and Android's hardware back are untouched:
       * neither goes through this button.
       *
       * Only when there IS somewhere to go back to. A deep link from a
       * widget opens this screen with nothing beneath it, and the system
       * would draw no arrow there — so neither does this.

  // the rows arrive AFTER the list has mounted, so it was always
  // undefined when it mattered — and fell back to asking `scrollToIndex`
  // again each time the list reported it had not measured that far.
  //
  // That walk is what this replaces. With dynamic row heights each round
  // mounted another batch, measured it, scrolled to the end of what was
  // measured and asked again, up to fourteen times — while the arriving
  // translations grew every row and set the whole thing going once more,
  // for four seconds. Deep in al-Baqarah it did not merely stutter:
  // opening at ayah 250 on an emulator moved the list at every sample for
  // three seconds and finished on BLANK SPACE, scrolled to an offset
  // computed from half-measured frames with no rows rendered there.
  //
  // `initialScrollIndex` looks like the answer and is not, for a reason
  // worth writing down so nobody spends the afternoon on it twice. It is
  // honoured at mount only — so the list has to wait for the rows, which
  // is fixable — but it also tells VirtualizedList to render its first
  // batch AT that index and never mount the rows above it, and without
  // `getItemLayout` there is nothing to give those unmounted rows a
  // height. The leading space collapses to nothing. Measured: the reader
  // lands on ayah 250 correctly and then cannot scroll back to 249,
  // because as far as the list is concerned 249 occupies no space and the
  // surah header is directly above. Trading a slow landing for 249
  // unreachable ayahs is not a fix.
  //
  // So the landing is not a scroll at all. The list is handed a WINDOW of
  // the surah that BEGINS at the ayah asked for, and opens at its top —
  // which is the ayah, with no scrolling, no measuring and no retries.
  // Reading backwards prepends the rows above a chunk at a time
  // (`onStartReached`), and `maintainVisibleContentPosition` keeps the
  // page still while they arrive, so scrolling up costs what scrolling
  // down costs. Nothing is ever unreachable and nothing is ever walked.
  //
  // The marker is still not written until the READER scrolls. Not "until
  // the ayah is on screen": a bookmark or a search result lands here too,
  // and a landing is a jump, which moves nothing (see `recordReading`).
