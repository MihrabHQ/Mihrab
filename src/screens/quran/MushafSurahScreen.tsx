 * its sheets and its render. Every muṣḥaf concern — the riwayah chip, the
 * fullscreen button, the page-derived title, the night-mode header tint,

 * reader also ran. They share a route and a toggle, and that is all they

       * is somewhere to go back to, as the system's would be. The swipe
       * and the hardware back do not go through it.
