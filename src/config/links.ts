 * The addresses the app points people at, in one place.

 * They were literals scattered across screens, and they drifted: the shared
 * month image was still printing the GitHub repo — with a QR code carrying
 * the app's old mosque icon — months after there was a website to send
 * people to, and Settings sent everyone to the source tree rather than to
 * the page written for them.
 *
 * The website is the front door. GitHub is for people who want the source,
 * which is a different audience and a different link.
