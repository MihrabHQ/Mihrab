 * Verdant — a tonal theme for DARK mode; light mode is the release look.

 * ── WHY LIGHT IS LEFT ALONE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every light version of a tinted page was tried — a whisper, pronounced,
 * tinted paper, vibrant — and none of them was the app. A light page that
 * carries the accent reads as pastel, mint or a slab; the app's light
 * identity is warm parchment with the accent as ink and as a few soft
 * highlights (`accentBg`), which is exactly what the shipped release does.
 * So under Verdant, light surfaces collapse to their neutral counterparts
 * and the accent keeps doing what it always did. The toggle still holds
 * (the flag is true, native hints still route), it simply has no surface
 * work to do until the sun goes down.
 *
 * ── DARK: A TONAL LADDER IN OKLCH ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A deep tinted ground reads as coloured night ink, which IS in character.
 * The ladder lifts toward light — bg → chrome → card → controlBg → strong
 * → border — one hue (the accent's own, held by OKLCH so RGB mixing cannot
 * drift it), chroma rising with lift, the accent the most saturated thing
 * on screen, and `controlBg` under the AA ceiling for muted ink (#95918A
 * needs ≲ L 0.29). One formula for all six presets, no per-accent table.
 * `__tests__/tintedSurfaces.test.ts` pins the ladder, the hierarchy, the
