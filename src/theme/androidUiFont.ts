/**
 * THE UI FACE ON ANDROID IS THE APP'S OWN — issue #16.
 *
 * `FONTS.primary` is undefined on purpose: the Latin UI has always been
 * set in whatever the platform calls sans-serif, which on stock Android
 * is Roboto. On a Huawei running EMUI it is the user's THEME font. A
 * themed nova drew every label, number and button in a cursive serif,
 * wider than the layouts were drawn for — the prayer times truncated to
 * "04:…", the tabs to "Du…", the header title to "Al-M…" — and switching
 * the theme off and on did not put it back. The bundled Arabic faces on
 * the same screens were untouched: a font the app loads from its own
 * resources is not the system's to replace.
 *
 * So on Android every Text asks for the bundled Roboto by name
 * (res/font/roboto.xml, registered in MainApplication). The family lacks
 * Arabic, Urdu and the rest, and for those glyphs Android falls back to
 * the system as it always did; what changes is that the app's Latin is
 * the app's on every phone.
 *
 * ── HOW ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * React Native has no default-font setting. Text is a plain function
 * component and `react-native`'s `Text` is a getter that reads the
 * module's default export at every use, so replacing that export with a
 * wrapper that puts the family FIRST in the style — every explicit
 * `fontFamily` in the app still wins, Amiri and the muṣḥaf faces above
 * all — reaches every Text in the app and its libraries. Loaded first in
 * index.js, before anything has taken a reference to the original.
 * TextInput the same, so a search field matches the labels around it.

 * A Text nested inside another Text inherits its parent's family — that
 * is how the muṣḥaf sets the riwayah face once on the line and colours
 * each word in a span. Forcing Roboto on those spans would override the
 * inheritance and drop the whole line to the system's Arabic fallback,
 * so the default is applied to ROOT texts only; a nested one is left as
 * written. `React.use` reads the context the same way Text itself does.
