/**
 * The floating tab bar's geometry, in one place — v2.8.5.
 *
 * The bar is absolutely positioned so that content passes UNDERNEATH it:
 * a list that ends exactly at a solid bar looks finished, and the reader
 * has no way to tell whether there is more below. A page sliding under a
 * floating pill says "there is more here" without spending a pixel on
 * saying it.
 *
 * The price of that is that the navigator no longer reserves any space,
 * so every scrolling screen has to reserve it instead — and a screen that
 * forgets ends with its last row permanently hidden. Hence one module:
 * the bar and the six screens read the same numbers, and changing the
 * bar's height cannot leave a screen behind.
