/**
 * The strip behind the system status bar, on a page that has no title bar
 * to cover it.
 *
 * ── WHY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No tab draws a header any more, and the app is edge to edge, so a tab's
 * content owns the window from the very top down. At rest that is fine —
 * every tab pads its content clear of the status bar. Scroll, though, and
 * whatever is at the top of the page rides up behind the clock and the
 * status icons and is drawn straight through them: reported first on
 * Today, where the location chip crossed the clock, and then on every
 * other tab and the pages inside them.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS ALWAYS THERE, AND NOT A FADE ────────────────────────────
 *
 * On these pages the strip already IS the page's colour: the content
 * starts below it. So a band of exactly that colour is invisible at rest
 * — there is nothing for it to fade in from — and the only thing it ever
 * does is hide what scrolls under it. That buys the fix without wiring a
 * scroll offset through six screens and the pages inside them, and
 * without a frame of the wrong colour on any of them.
 *
 * Today is the exception and does not use this: its sky runs up under the
 * status bar on purpose and nothing is drawn over it there
 * (`HomeStatusBand` only sets the glyphs' ink).
 *
 * The pushed subpages do not use it either: they carry a real header,
 * which is the surface that covers the strip there.
