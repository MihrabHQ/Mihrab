/**
 * The page dissolving into the floating tab bar, instead of crashing into
 * it.
 *
 * The pill is translucent (`translucentSurface`, 88%) and the page scrolls
 * under it — that is the point of a floating bar, it says "there is more
 * here". But translucency over live text with nothing in between does not
 * read as depth: on every scrolling tab a row of body text, or a whole row
 * of pill buttons on the Log, showed through the bar and overlapped its
 * labels, and the app looked unfinished rather than layered. Seen on the
 * device on all five scrolling tabs, 2026-09-08.
 *
 * This is the thing that was missing: a short vertical fade from nothing
 * to the page colour, painted behind the bar and reaching a little above
 * it, so content is already gone by the time it would meet the pill. It
 * lives in the tab navigator's `screenLayout` — under the bar, over the
 * screen — and it fades out with the bar when the bar slides away, driven
 * by the same `Animated.Value`, so the two can never be out of step.
 *
 * ONLY FOR A PLAIN HEX, for the same reason `translucentSurface` is: under
 * Liquid Glass `palette.bg` is a `PlatformColor`, an SVG stop cannot take
 * one, and that theme brings its own material anyway. And only where the
 * bar floats — on iPad and Mac it is in flow and the page ends above it.
