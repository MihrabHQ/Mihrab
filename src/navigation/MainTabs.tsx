/**
 * The six tabs (design review 2e): Today · Quran · Tasbih · Duas · Log ·
 * Settings.
 *
 * What moved and why:
 *
 *   • A "More" tab is an admission the deciding was never finished. With
 *     Mosques cut and Month folded into Settings there was nothing left for
 *     it to hold, so the sixth tab became what people were reaching for
 *     anyway.
 *   • Tasbih and Duas are separate. Bundling them as "Dhikr" saved a tab and
 *     cost clarity: one is a counter you tap fifty times, the other is a
 *     library you read. Tasbih is now one tap away right after prayer.
 *   • Find a masjid is gone — maps apps do it better, and it was the one
 *     feature needing a network round-trip in an otherwise offline app.
 *   • Qibla lost its tile and became a compass button in the Today header,
 *     next to the location it depends on.
 *
 * Six is the ceiling, not a target: iOS collapses to five-plus-More unless
 * the bar is explicitly six, and Android's guidance caps at five. If a
 * seventh is ever needed, re-merge Tasbih and Duas rather than bringing
 * "More" back.
 *
 * The bar itself is a floating rounded pill rather than a full-width slab
 * welded to the bottom edge — see `tabBarStyle` below. Readers never see
 * it: the mushaf is pushed onto the root stack ON TOP of the tabs.
