/**
 * The way back to Today, in the title bar of every other tab.
 *
 * ── WHY A TAB HAS A BACK BUTTON AT ALL ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because this app already behaves as though it does. `decideAndroidBack`
 * has always sent hardware back from Quran, Tasbih, Duas, the Log and
 * Settings to Today, and treated Today as the one screen you cannot leave
 * — so the model is not six peer tabs, it is Today plus five pages you
 * went to. That model was only ever expressed in a gesture. Someone on a
 * page with a title bar and no arrow in it reads the tabs as peers, and
 * then the hardware back landing on Today looks like a bug rather than the
 * rule it is.
 *
 * So the arrow says out loud what the gesture already did. It is the same
 * control a pushed page gets from the navigator — the system one there,
 * this one here, because a tab's header is drawn in JS and has no back
 * control of its own to turn on.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT ANDROID-ONLY ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The hardware-back rule is, because only Android has the button. The
 * MEANING is not: Today is home on every platform, and a back arrow that
 * appeared and vanished with the OS would make the same screen a different
 * shape on a phone and on an iPad — which is exactly the kind of drift the
 * six tabs were unified to stop.
 *
 * ── THE ARROW ITSELF ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Drawn to match the platform's own: a thin chevron on iOS, an arrow with
 * a shaft on Android, at the same 2pt stroke the rest of the header icons
 * use. It has to read as a sibling of the arrow on a pushed settings page,
 * because a user moving between them is looking at one control.
 *
 * ── WHICH WAY IT POINTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * At the edge it sits on. A chevron is a direction, not a letter, so in
 * Arabic, Urdu, Farsi and Hebrew, where "back" is the trailing edge, the
 * glyph turns around.
 *
 * Which edge that is depends on who laid the button out, and in this app
 * the two answers differ. The app mirrors itself with a Yoga `direction`
 * on the root view rather than `I18nManager.forceRTL` (see
 * `i18n/useLayoutRtl`), so an ordinary JS row — the Duas category bar —
 * mirrors with the APP's language and puts the arrow on the right. A
 * native stack header does not: `react-native-screens` hands its
 * `headerLeft` slot to the platform's own toolbar, which places it by the
 * DEVICE's layout direction, and that stays left-to-right for everyone as
 * long as `forceRTL` is off. So on an English phone with the app in Arabic
 * the reader's arrow is on the left and the Duas one is on the right, and
 * both are right — each points at the edge its own container calls back.
 *
 * Hence `rtl` is asked for rather than assumed. This shipped reading
 * `I18nManager.isRTL` unconditionally, which is the device's answer handed
 * to a row the device did not lay out: the Duas arrow sat on the trailing
 * edge in Arabic, pointing away from it.
