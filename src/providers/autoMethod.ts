/**
 * Which calculation method "Automatic" means, when the app has to answer
 * for itself.
 *
 * "Automatic" was always AlAdhan's job: omit `method` and its server picks
 * one from the coordinates. That left the on-device path with nothing to go
 * on, so it hardcoded MWL (3) — fine as a global default, wrong wherever a
 * country has its own parameters. It only ever showed up offline, which is
 * to say rarely, which is to say nobody reported it.
 *
 * It matters more now: the on-device computation is the rung underneath
 * every provider, the one that cannot fail (`prayerStorage.ts`), so it is
 * what a Moroccan user gets on a plane or past a published window. Answering
 * "MWL" there would be a visible minutes-level error against the table they
 * pray by.
 *
 * The table stays deliberately small: an entry belongs here only where a
 * country's own method is in `CALCULATION_METHODS` and the region predicate
 * already exists for provider routing. Everywhere else MWL remains the
 * honest answer.
