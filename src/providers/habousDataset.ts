/**
 * Morocco — the Ministry of Habous's published tables, served from a
 * prepared dataset.
 *
 * The same arrangement as `islamiskaForbundetDataset.ts`: a scheduled job
 * scrapes the ministry once, server-side, and commits per-city JSON plus a
 * small `index.json` (see `tools/habous-dataset/`). Devices read that. Read
 * the Swedish module first; this explains only what differs.
 *
 * ── WHY A DATASET AND NOT A CALCULATION ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The app CAN compute Moroccan times, and since the Morocco method gained
 * the ministry's own margins it lands within a minute of the published
 * table (see `localAdhan.ts`). But the ministry computes each city from its
 * own reference point, and those are not published — so a calculation from
 * the user's GPS is always close and never identical. Where an authority
 * publishes the times its country prays by, serving those beats
 * approximating them.
 *
 * ── THE SHORTER WINDOW ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The ministry's page has no date parameter: it returns whatever Hijri
 * month it is showing. So the builder cannot walk a horizon, it accumulates
 * one month at a time, and the forward window is weeks rather than the
 * Swedish year. A miss here is therefore ordinary rather than alarming, and
 * it falls through to the computed chain — which for Morocco is a good
 * fallback rather than a cliff.
 *
 * ── KEYED BY ID, NOT NAME ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The ministry's `ville` id addresses the page and names the file. Its
 * Arabic city names are NOT unique — تاهلة appears twice — so keying by
 * name would quietly lose a city.
