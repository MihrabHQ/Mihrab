/**
 * Which of the ministry's cities is nearest, and how far away.

 * Sweden's equivalent (`islamiskaForbundetNearest.ts`) keys by city NAME.
 * This keys by the ministry's own numeric `ville` id, because that is what
 * addresses a page and names a dataset file, and because the Arabic names
 * are not unique — تاهلة appears twice in the ministry's list, at 303 and
 * as 94. A name-keyed map would silently lose one of them.
 *
 * Pure and offline: a brute-force haversine over ~191 entries costs
 * nothing, and doing it without a network call is what lets provider
 * selection happen before anything has loaded.
