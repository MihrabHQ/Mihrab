/**
 * What leaves the app as text — issue #24.
 *
 * A reader asked to be able to send a dua or a tafsir passage to family,
 * or into Notes, the way an ayah could already be sent. Sharing an ayah
 * as text was written inline in the ayah sheet; two more of these, each
 * assembling its own string somewhere else, is how three formats drift
 * apart and how one of them quietly loses its attribution.
 *
 * ── ATTRIBUTION IS NOT A FIELD, IT IS THE POINT ───────────────────────
 *
 * CLAUDE.md §4: religious content must be sourced and attributed. That
 * rule is easy to keep on a screen, where the source line is drawn beside
 * the text and nobody has to remember it. It is easy to LOSE in a share
 * body, because a share body is assembled by hand, read once by whoever
 * wrote it, and then travels without the app around it — a dua pasted
 * into a family group with no source is a claim about the religion with
 * nothing behind it, and the person who receives it has no way back to
 * where it came from.
 *
 * So every builder here takes its attribution as a required argument and
 * `attributed()` refuses to produce a body without one. A future fourth
 * share cannot forget: it will throw the first time it is used, in a
 * test, rather than ship a quotation with no chain.
 *
 * The shape is the one the ayah share already used, so the three read as
 * one app: blocks separated by a blank line, attribution last behind an
 * em dash.
