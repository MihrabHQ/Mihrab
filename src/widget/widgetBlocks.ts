/**
 * Everything the home-screen widgets read BESIDES prayer times.
 *
 * Six widget kinds need five different slices of app state, and each one of
 * them arriving as its own schema change would be five migrations of the
 * payload the native renderers parse. So the blocks are defined once, here,
 * built by pure functions, and hung off `WidgetPrayerPayload` as optional
 * fields — a renderer that does not know a block simply never looks at it.
 *
 * All of it is OPTIONAL on purpose. The widget process cannot read the
 * encrypted journal blob and must not try: practice data is sensitive, it
 * lives behind `durableEncryptedGet`, and a widget extension has no business
 * holding that key. The app reads it, reduces it to the few numbers a 4x4
 * grid can show, and pushes that. A block is absent when the app has not
 * pushed it yet, which every renderer must treat as "do not draw the
 * section" rather than as zero — a streak of 0 and an unknown streak look
 * identical on screen and mean opposite things.

 * across the full width of a 4x3: seven rows of fourteen columns is a 2:1
 * shape in a box three times as wide as it is tall, so the graph sat in the

 * that can give — a week is seven days — so the window grew until there are
 * always more weeks available than the widest card can show, and the card
 * takes as many as fit at full size rather than stretching what it has.
 *
 * THIRTY now, because "more than the widest card can show" was not true.
 * Twenty-six columns is a shape about 3.8 times wider than it is tall, and
 * a 4x4's grid box on a 480dpi phone is 3.4 — inside it, but with nothing
 * to spare, and a card whose chrome measured a few dp shorter would have
 * been outside it with no way to say so except by stopping short of its own

 * takes; a tablet flatter than that gets every week there is, which is the
 * honest answer rather than a silent gap.
