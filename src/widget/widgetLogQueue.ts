/**
 * Taps on the Log Today widget, on their way to the journal.
 *
 * ── Why a queue, and not a write ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The journal is an ENCRYPTED blob. A widget's broadcast receiver is
 * Kotlin, it has no access to the key, and even if it did it would have to
 * reimplement `upsertEntry`'s rule that an existing status is never
 * overwritten — so an accidental double press cannot clear a "missed" the
 * user set on purpose. Two implementations of that rule is one too many;
 * the one in `prayerLogAction.logPrayerOnTime` is the writer, and it stays
 * the only one.
 *
 * The alternative was a HeadlessJsTaskService: spin up the whole React
 * Native runtime on a tap, run the write in JS, tear it down. That is
 * seconds of work for one line of journal, Android 12+ restricts starting
 * services from the background anyway, and the user is standing there
 * waiting for a checkmark. So the receiver appends to a queue in the same
 * SharedPreferences the payload already lives in — a few bytes, instant —
 * and the app drains it through the real writer at the next opportunity.
 *
 * ── What the user sees ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Immediately: the tick. The widget renders the queue over the payload, so
 * a tapped prayer reads as logged the moment it is tapped, whether or not
 * the app has run since.
 *
 * ── The undo window falls out of this for free ────────────────────────
 *
 * Tapping the same prayer again inside the undo window removes it from the
 * queue instead of adding a second entry. Nothing had been written yet, so
 * "undo" is a deletion from a list rather than a journal edit that has to
 * decide what the previous status was.
 *
 * ── Which day an entry lands on ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The date is stamped when the tap happens and travels with the entry, for
 * the reason `prayerLogAction` gives about notifications: Isha fires at
 * 23:40 in a Swedish winter and is answered at 00:05, and a drain that used
 * "today" would credit the wrong day and leave the real one blank.
