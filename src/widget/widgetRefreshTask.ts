/**
 * The refresh glyph on a home-screen widget, as the user means it.
 *
 * It used to redraw the card from the payload already on disk. That is a
 * reasonable reading of "refresh" and not the one anybody has: a person
 * tapping it has noticed that what they are looking at is not what they
 * expect, and the most common reason for that — on a phone paired with
 * another device — is that the record on the other device has not arrived
 * yet. Redrawing the same stale bytes answers a question nobody asked.
 *
 * So the button now runs a real sync round first, then rebuilds the payload
 * so anything that arrived is on the card before it is drawn again. The
 * native side redraws immediately as well, so the tap still feels instant
 * and this catches up behind it.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS ALLOWED TO COST SOMETHING ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * 2.11.0 went to some trouble to stop the app doing work in the background
 * nobody asked for. This is the opposite case: a deliberate press, in front
 * of the user, on a control whose whole purpose is "go and check". It is
 * also the only way to sync from outside the app — auto-sync runs while the
 * app is open, and a widget is precisely what someone looks at instead of
 * opening the app.
 *
 * It still declines to do the expensive half when there is nothing to gain:
 * `syncIsReady()` is a cached read of the settings and the peer list, and
 * without a folder AND a paired device a round has nothing to write and
 * nowhere to write it.

/**
 * Two presses in quick succession are one intent.
 *
 * The glyph is small and the card does not visibly change while a round is

 * reads the same folder for the same answer at twice the cost. Short enough
 * that a genuine "no, really, check again" a few seconds later still runs.
