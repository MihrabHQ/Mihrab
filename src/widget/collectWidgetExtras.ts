/**
 * Gather the non-prayer-times blocks from the app's own stores.

 * Deliberately NOT a hook. Five hooks threaded through HomeScreen to feed
 * one JSON string would put the widget's concerns in a screen that has
 * nothing to do with widgets, and would re-render it every time a bead was
 * counted. This reads the stores directly, at the moment the payload is
 * built, and returns a plain object.
 *
 * Every read is independently guarded. The widget is best-effort: an
 * unreadable Quran blob must not cost the user their prayer times, which
 * are the reason the widget exists.
