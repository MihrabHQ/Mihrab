/**
 * "The first real frame is on screen" — as a latch anything can wait on.
 *
 * ── WHY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The moment the Today card first has its times, the same effect flush
 * that draws them also rebuilds the whole prayer-alert schedule, the
 * end-of-day and adhkār reminders, the home-screen widget's payload (a
 * storage read, a build, a native write) and the Live Activity's, and
 * `AppNavigationRoot` is draining the widget's tap queue and republishing
 * on top. None of it is on screen. All of it ran on the JS thread in the
 * same breath as the first paint, and a cold start measured 87 ms
 * between the ready render's commit and the next animation frame — the
 * frame the reader was waiting for, queued behind bookkeeping.
 *
 * So that work waits for this. It is not cancelled and not made rarer;
 * it starts one frame later than it did, after the card is drawn.
 *
 * ── WHO MARKS IT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `HomeScreen`, once its first `ready` render has been committed and a
 * frame has gone by. Not every launch reaches that — onboarding, a
 * location error, the Mac with no location yet — so a timer marks it
 * anyway a few seconds in, and the side work runs as it always did.
 * Marking is idempotent; the promise resolves once and stays resolved.
