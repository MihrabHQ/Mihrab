/**
 * One reader for the three things the app records about a day's practice —
 * prayers logged, fasting, dhikr — so more than one screen can show them.
 *
 * Home's "Today" summary (design review 2a) and the merged Log tab (2c) both
 * need the same three facts, and they were locked inside the journal and
 * fasting screens as local `useState`. This module owns the READ side and a
 * change notification; the screens keep owning their writes and call
 * `notifyPracticeChanged()` after persisting. The cache is dropped on every
 * such notification, so the two can never disagree.
 *
 * Dhikr had no persistence at all — the tasbih counter lived and died with
 * its screen — so a completed set is recorded here. Without it the Today
 * summary would have to state a dhikr line it has no evidence for, and a
 * summary that invents its own content is worse than one that omits a row.
