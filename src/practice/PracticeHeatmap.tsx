/**
 * Every week you have ever logged, two facts per square (design review 2c).
 *
 * Prayers and fasting are the same act — recording what you did today — and
 * they were split across two screens with two visual languages. One graph
 * carries both: FILL DEPTH is prayers logged (0→5), an INSET RING is the
 * fast. They never collide because they use different channels, so either
 * can be read alone or both at once; a second grid would have doubled the
 * screen for half the insight.
 *
 * The ring rather than another colour step, because fasting is not "more
 * prayer" — it is a different axis, and it cannot be another rung on the
 * green ramp. An outline reads as a distinct category, and the two amber
 * days a week (Mondays and Thursdays) show up as a rhythm rather than noise.
 *
 * Rows are weekdays, so a habit that fails on Fridays — or a Ramadan block —
 * reads as a shape.
 *
 * IT SCROLLS, and it reaches the first day you ever logged. It used to be
 * thirteen fixed weeks, defended on the grounds that "a hard month scrolls
 * out of view rather than standing as a monument". That reasoning protected
 * the user from their own record and took the record with it: a year in,
 * every square earned before April was simply gone, with no way back to it.
 * Ownership of the data wins — you can always look away from a graph, but
 * you cannot look at one that was never drawn. The grid now runs from the
 * Monday of the earliest entry to this week, and opens parked on today, so
 * the default view is still the recent one.
 *
 * An empty square is warm paper, never grey: the GitHub reading of
 * "empty = failure" is not a judgement this app should make about a
 * religious practice.

   * per measurement while the content still fits, and the graph settles at
   * the first span that overflows — which is the first span you can drag.
