/**
 * The four numbers above the graph.
 *
 * They exist because the card was being asked to answer two different
 * questions with one mark. A square carrying fill depth, a fast ring, a
 * sunnah line, a missed dot, a qiyam dot and a selection outline is six
 * encodings on 18 points — which is why its legend needed two rows, and why
 * "how am I doing" was something you had to decode rather than read.
 *
 * Totals are not a heatmap's job. They are four headline numbers, so they
 * should be four numbers. The grid keeps the per-day marks, which are the
 * thing totals cannot tell you: WHICH days.
 *
 * Pure on purpose — no storage, no clock beyond what is handed in — so the
 * arithmetic can be tested without a device.
