/**
 * The check beside each prayer on Today — one tap records the prayer.
 *
 * ── WHAT A TAP RECORDS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Inside the prayer's own window, one tap records it `on-time`: the row
 * knows what time it is, and nobody is asked. Once the window has
 * closed — later the same day, or on a day the card has been turned back
 * to — the tap ASKS instead: was it prayed on time, or made up? A tap
 * used to write `late` there on its own, which was the clock's answer
 * and not the reader's: someone marking yesterday's Fajr at breakfast
 * usually prayed it at Fajr, and a check that silently recorded
 * otherwise had to be corrected on the Log. So the row asks, once
 * (`LogPassedPrayerSheet`), and writes what it is told. A second tap
 * un-logs it either way (a tombstone, like the Log's own deselect) —
 * nothing to ask about undoing.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASKS DEPENDS ON THE MOMENT — issue #40. With the Mālikī second
 * times on, a window has two halves, and the half it is in is an answer
 * nobody should have to give twice: inside the second window the only
 * question is the first time or after it, because the prayer can still
 * be prayed in its own time and nothing is qaḍāʾ yet. Once the whole
 * window has gone — for everybody, with those times or without — all
 * four of the Log's statuses are on the table, missed among them, and
 * `late` is no longer the app's guess at which.
 *
 * ── THE WINDOW ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each prayer's window runs from its time to the next event that ends it:
 * Fajr to sunrise, Dhuhr to Asr, Asr to Maghrib, Maghrib to Isha, and Isha
 * to the next day's Fajr — or, when tomorrow is not to hand, to the end of
 * the day. The window belongs to the DAY OF THE CARD, not to the clock's
 * day: yesterday's Isha is still open before this morning's Fajr, and
 * tomorrow's Fajr has not come whatever the hour. A prayer whose time has
 * not come cannot be tapped: there is nothing to record yet.
 *
 * The write path is the Log screen's, not a new one: encrypt to the same
 * key, prime the shared cache first so every surface updates at once,
 * retire the evening reminder for a fully logged day, and drop the
 * second-time alerts of a prayer that has been answered.
