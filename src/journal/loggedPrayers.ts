/**
 * Which prayers a day already holds a record for.
 *
 * Small enough to inline and separate on purpose: three callers need the
 * same answer and none of them should be the one that owns it. The
 * notification schedule asks it to leave a recorded prayer's boundaries
 * alone (issue #23), the Log asks it when a row is written, and the
 * action handler behind a notification asks it with no screen mounted.
 *
 * "Logged" means a record exists, whatever it says. A prayer marked
 * `missed` has been accounted for as surely as one marked on time, and
 * telling someone their missed prayer is about to become qaḍāʾ is the
 * same contradiction in a sadder key.
