/**
 * When this app first existed on this phone.
 *
 * Needed by exactly one feature — the backfill button, which fills the
 * journal from the install date to yesterday — and it has to be honest,
 * because every day it names becomes a claim in the user's own record.
 *
 * Three sources, best first:
 *
 * 1. The platform's own install date. Android reads it from the package
 *    manager's `firstInstallTime`; iOS from the creation date of the app
 *    container's Documents directory, which is made once and survives every
 *    update. Both are the FIRST install, never the last update — an update
 *    date would offer a year-old user a single day to fill, which is this
 *    feature failing exactly the people it is for.
 * 2. A stamp this module writes on first run, for the case where the
 *    platform will not say.
 * 3. The earliest day already in the journal, when that is older still —
 *    restoring a backup onto a new phone makes the container younger than
 *    the record it holds.
 *
 * ── The stamp is a floor, not a date ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Source 2 is worth being careful about, because for anyone who already
 * had the app it records the day they UPDATED to this version, and that is
 * exactly the wrong answer. It is therefore only consulted when the
 * platform gave nothing, and even then it can only make the range smaller,
 * never larger — the maximum of nothing is still nothing.
 *
 * Under-reaching is the deliberate direction of every fallback. A button
 * that offers fewer days than it might is a small disappointment; one that
 * invents months the user never had the app is a false record, and this
 * app's whole claim is that the record is theirs.
