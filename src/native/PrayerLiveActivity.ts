/**
 * Typed wrapper for the PrayerLiveActivity native module (iOS only).
 *
 * On Android the Live Activity is implemented entirely in JS via notifee
 * (see `src/notifications/liveActivity.ts`) — the module returned here
 * is always `null` and callers must skip into the notifee path.
 *
 * On iOS the module will (in a follow-up — task #129) bridge into
 * ActivityKit so the user gets a Lock-Screen Live Activity and Dynamic
 * Island treatment. Until that lands the native module is unavailable
 * and `getPrayerLiveActivityModule()` returns null, so the orchestrator
 * silently no-ops on iOS.
