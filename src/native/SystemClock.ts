/**
 * Typed wrapper for the SystemClock native module — issue #18.
 *
 * Answers one question: is the device clock set to 24-hour time? Neither
 * platform lets JavaScript see this. Android keeps it in
 * `Settings.System.TIME_12_24`, outside the locale entirely; iOS folds it
 * into the current locale in a way `Intl` on Hermes does not reliably
 * reproduce. So both sides answer natively and agree on one boolean.
 *
 * `null` means nobody could be asked — an older build without the module,
 * or the test environment — and `resolveHour12` then falls back to
 * 24-hour, which is what this app has shown since its first release.
 *
 * One store, not one per component. Every prayer time on screen asks this
 * question, and a month table has two hundred of them; a subscription per
 * caller would mean two hundred `AppState` listeners and two hundred
 * bridge calls on every foreground. So the answer lives here, is re-read
 * once when the app becomes active, and is published to whoever is
 * listening.
 *
 * ── THE CONSTANT AND THE METHOD HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES ──────────────────
 *
 * The native side exports a constant `is24Hour` (there at startup, no
 * round trip) and a method `readIs24Hour()` (re-asked on foreground).
 * They used to share a name, and one of them was unreachable in every
 * bridge mode: the New Architecture's interop layer resolves methods
 * first and never exposes a same-named constant, while the legacy bridge
 * `Object.assign`s the constants over the module and buries the method.
 * The visible result was `auto` starting as 24-hour on every cold start
 * and flipping once the promise came back. Now the constant is read
 * through `getConstants()` where the interop layer offers it and off the
 * module object where the legacy bridge puts it, and a refresh is kicked
 * off at module load rather than waiting for a subscriber.
