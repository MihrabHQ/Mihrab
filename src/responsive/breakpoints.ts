/**
 * Responsive breakpoints + helpers — task #33 (iPad / macOS via "Designed

 * iPhone apps run on Apple Silicon Macs and iPads via the "Designed for
 * iPad" / "iPhone" delivery; without intentional layout work they look
 * locked-portrait and tiny on a 27" Mac display. This module defines the
 * three width breakpoints the app commits to:
 *
 *   • COMPACT   (< 700pt) — phone portrait, the historical layout.
 *   • REGULAR   (700–1100pt) — iPad portrait, larger phone landscape, Mac small window.
 *   • EXPANDED  (≥ 1100pt) — iPad landscape, Mac wide window.
 *
 * Screens consult `useBreakpoint()` to switch layouts (single column →
 * master-detail, modal sheet → centered popover, day carousel widening,
 * etc.).
