/**
 * ResponsiveModal — one modal primitive that adapts to window size (task #33).
 *
 *   • COMPACT (phone)          → bottom sheet that slides up, full width,
 *                                rounded top corners, respects the safe-area
 *                                inset. The historical phone treatment.
 *   • REGULAR / EXPANDED       → a centered popover card, capped width, that
 *                                fades in over a dimmed backdrop — the natural
 *                                iPad / Mac desktop affordance.
 *
 * Tapping the backdrop closes. Content is caller-supplied; this component only
 * owns the container chrome (backdrop, card, positioning, animation).

          THE DISMISS TARGET SITS BEHIND THE CARD, NOT AROUND IT.

          It used to wrap it: a Pressable for the backdrop, and a second
          Pressable around the card whose only job was to swallow taps so
          touching the sheet did not close it. That second one also
          swallowed SCROLLING, and it did it in a way that looked like a
          working sheet to every test.

          A Pressable claims the JS touch responder on touch-down, and RN
          on Android answers that by telling the native hierarchy to stop
          intercepting — which is precisely what a native ScrollView does
          to start scrolling. The claim is a round trip through the JS
          thread, so the outcome is a RACE: a fast fling reaches the
          native scroll view before the answer comes back and scrolls
          normally; a finger dragging at human speed does not, and the
          list sits still. `adb shell input swipe … 300` scrolled the
          changelog on every device tried; the same swipe over 1800 ms
          never moved it once. So did a person's thumb.

          A plain View underneath needs no responder: taps on the card
          land on a view with no handler and do nothing, which is all the
          swallowing that was ever wanted, and the scroll view below is
          left to negotiate with the platform on its own.
