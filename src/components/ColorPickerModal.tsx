// under the finger that is choosing.
/**
 * Pick a colour by eye, or by code — from the colours that work.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS BUILT RATHER THAN INSTALLED ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every colour-picker package worth using is several hundred kilobytes
 * and drags in a gesture or animation runtime of its own. This app ships
 * on F-Droid, where every dependency is a thing somebody has to be able
 * to build from source, and it already has the two pieces a picker needs:
 * `react-native-svg` draws the gradients and `PanResponder` (the same one
 * the muṣḥaf page scrubber uses) reads the drag. So this is about two
 * hundred lines and no new dependency.
 *
 * ── THE SHAPE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The standard one: a saturation/value square under the current hue, a
 * hue strip beneath it, and a hex field. HSV rather than HSL because in
 * HSL that square is a diamond with unreachable corners.
 *
 * The two halves are one value. Dragging moves the hex; typing a hex
 * moves the thumbs. Neither is the source of truth — `hsv` is, and the
 * field is re-rendered from it except while it is being edited, because
 * re-formatting a half-typed `#1a2` under the cursor is how a hex field
 * becomes impossible to use.
 *
 * ── THE SQUARE IS THE SHAPE OF WHAT YOU CAN HAVE ──────────────────────
 *
 * It used to offer every colour and print a red warning under the ones
 * that would be unreadable on the background they were headed for. Now
 * it only shows the ones that work: the rest of the square is covered by
 * a flat inert panel, so the colour field is a shape with a curved edge
 * and the thumb cannot leave it. `constrainToLegible` does the clamping
 * and `legibleBoundary` gives the curve.
 *
 * The first attempt at this veiled the unusable part in the background's
 * own colour, on the theory that those colours really do sink into that
 * background. It read beautifully in the abstract and looked broken on a
 * device, for a reason worth writing down: the veil is least visible
 * exactly where it is needed. The unusable colours on a light ground are
 * the light ones, so washing them towards paper turned the top of the
 * square into a blank white slab; the unusable ones on a dark ground are
 * the dark ones, so washing them towards the night ground was invisible
 * against the black the value gradient already ends in, leaving nothing
 * but an unexplained diagonal seam. Translucency over a gradient also
 * leaves a ghost of the spectrum behind, which reads as a rendering
 * fault rather than as a boundary.
 *
 * Clipping has none of those failure modes. There is no ghost, the edge
 * is the same crisp line whichever way the constraint runs, and the
 * shape carries real information: sweep the hue to blue at night and the
 * field collapses to a small wedge, which is the honest picture of how
 * little usable blue there is on a near-black ground.
 *
 * A typed hex is the one place the limit can still be argued with, since
 * somebody typing six digits is naming an exact colour. It is pulled to
 * the nearest colour that works and the sheet says so, once, in the
 * quiet voice — an account of what happened rather than a warning about
 * what the person did.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT DOES NOT MIRROR IN ARABIC ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The canvas carries `direction: 'ltr'` deliberately. An SVG gradient is
 * drawn in the SVG's own coordinate space, which does not flip with the
 * tree; a thumb positioned by percentage inside an RTL parent does. Left
 * them to disagree and the thumb reads the far end of the spectrum from
 * the colour under it. A spectrum is a canvas, not a list — it has no
 * reading order to mirror, which is the same reason the hero's sky does
 * not flip either.
