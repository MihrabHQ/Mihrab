/**
 * Which school, and what follows from it — issues #21 and #22.
 *
 * ── WHY A SCHOOL AND NOT A SHADOW ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The app asked one madhab-shaped question — the Ḥanafī 2:1 ʿaṣr shadow —
 * as a switch inside Calculation, and everything else that varies by
 * school hung off its own toggle beside it. A Ḥanafī ʿaṣr plus the Mālikī
 * second times drew a card that disagreed with itself, which the settings
 * screen had to explain in red. Asking for the school instead lets the
 * app answer the questions that follow from it, and stops that
 * combination being reachable by accident.
 *
 * ── WHAT A SCHOOL DECIDES HERE, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT ──────────────────
 *
 * It decides what the times ARE and what they are CALLED: the ʿaṣr
 * shadow, and — under Mālikī — that the farḍ at dawn is Ṣubḥ rather than
 * Fajr, which is the whole of #22.
 *
 * It does NOT turn anything on. The Mālikī second times add rows and fire
 * alerts, and picking a school should not quietly start interrupting
 * somebody; that stays its own toggle, offered under Mālikī. This is the
 * line the whole design rests on: a school changes what is true, not what
 * happens.
 *
 * ── FOUR NAMES, TWO COMPUTED ANSWERS ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Shāfiʿī, Mālikī and Ḥanbalī take the same 1:1 shadow, so choosing
 * between them changes nothing the calculator does — except the name at
 * dawn under Mālikī. The picker says so rather than implying four
 * different sets of times: an app that pretends to know more fiqh than it
 * does is worse than one that says what it computes.
 *
 * ── AND NOBODY IS MOVED ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `null` is Custom, and it is what every existing install upgrades into:
 * their toggles as they stand, no school claimed, not a minute different.
 * Changing the ʿaṣr shadow by hand afterwards returns to Custom rather
 * than silently leaving a school's name on a combination it does not
 * describe.

/**
 * The farḍ at dawn — Ṣubḥ under the Mālikī reckoning, Fajr otherwise.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS OVERRIDES A STRING INSTEAD OF ADDING A KEY ───────────────
 *
 * `prayer.Fajr` is used in twenty-nine places: the day's rows, the month
 * table, the Log, the share sheet, notification titles and bodies, both
 * platforms' widgets, the Live Activity, and the settings screens that
 * list prayers. Threading a second key through all of them is twenty-nine
 * chances to miss one, and the one missed is the one somebody screenshots.
 *
 * So the KEY is unchanged and the STRING it resolves to is what moves,
 * which is also the honest statement of the feature: the prayer that key
 * denotes is called Ṣubḥ under this reckoning, and Fajr is the sunnah
 * before it. Every surface follows without knowing anything about madhāhib.
 *
 * Re-applied on a language change as well as a school change: the
 * override lives in one language's resource bundle, and switching
 * language loads the untouched one.
