/**
 * WHEN THE CLOCKS CHANGE UNDER THE APP — issue #56.
 *
 * Reported by Yushi on the day Morocco went back to GMT: Fajr was still
 * being shown at 05:49 when the country had moved to 04:49, and it stayed
 * that way for hours.
 *
 * ── WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every prayer time this app stores is a wall-clock string. "05:49" is not
 * a moment; it is a moment under a rule, and on 2026-09-20 Morocco changed
 * the rule. Nothing in the stored data changed, nothing expired, and
 * nothing was old — the rows were fetched yesterday and cover tomorrow.
 * The country moved and the table did not.
 *
 * The app found out the way it finds out about everything else on those
 * datasets: the ministry's builder republished, and the device's six-hourly
 * `index.json` poll eventually noticed a new `builtAt`. Six hours, ±25%,
 * and only while something asks for a time. That is the three hours in the
 * report, and it is the whole of the fault: the offset change was knowable
 * on the device, in the first millisecond, from the device's own clock.
 *
 * ── SO THE OFFSET IS THE SIGNAL ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The device knows its UTC offset and it knows what that offset was the
 * last time it stored any prayer times. When those disagree, every
 * wall-clock string held for where the reader IS was written under a rule
 * that no longer applies, and no amount of freshness makes it right. That
 * is not a reason to re-poll on the usual schedule; it is a reason to throw
 * the answer away and ask again now.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES NOT DO ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not touch the OTHER places a traveller has stored. A cache slot
 * is keyed by coordinates and holds times in the local clock of those
 * coordinates: flying Stockholm → Casablanca changes this device's offset
 * and changes nothing whatsoever about Stockholm's table. Only the location
 * being loaded is invalidated, which is the one the reader is standing in
 * and the one the shift is about.
 *
 * It also cannot help a phone whose own timezone database is out of date.
 * If the device still thinks Casablanca is GMT+1, the device's clock is
 * wrong and every app on it is wrong together; there is nothing here to
 * detect and nothing to fix.

 *     refilled by the load that follows; and
 *   • the dataset's cached city file, which is the one that mattered in
 *     the report — for Morocco the dataset is consulted BEFORE the cache,
 *     so an untouched city file means the fresh cache is never even read.
 *
 * The dataset download is awaited, the cache drop is awaited, and both
 * happen before the load that will read them. Neither can fail the load:
 * a device that is offline when the clocks change keeps nothing wrong on
 * purpose — the stored rows go, and the computed chain answers from the
 * device's own clock, which is by definition running under the new rule.
