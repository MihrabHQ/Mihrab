/**
 * When a day's card has nothing left to say.
 *
 * The hero has always rolled over on its own: `getNextPrayerDisplay` looks
 * at tomorrow as well as today, so the moment Ishāʾ passes the countdown is
 * already pointed at tomorrow's Fajr. The table under it was not — it stayed
 * on the calendar day until midnight, which left the top of the screen
 * counting down to a time the rows below it did not contain, for the four or
 * five hours of the evening when someone is most likely to be looking ahead
 * rather than back.
 *
 * ── WHAT "NOTHING LEFT" MEANS ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The last row on the card, not Ishāʾ. Which row that is depends on what the
 * reader has turned on: the First Third of the night sits after Ishāʾ (it
 * belongs to the night that BEGINS on this card — see `utils/nightTimes`),
 * so with #14's toggle on the day runs a couple of hours longer than Ishāʾ
 * and rolling at Ishāʾ would hide a row that had not happened yet.
 *
 * Islamic Midnight and the Last Third are the other way round: on this card
 * they are the small hours of THIS morning, already behind us, and they sort
 * before Fajr. Taking the latest instant on the card rather than the last
 * key in `DISPLAY_ORDER` gets both cases right without knowing which is
 * which.
 *
 * ── THE TWO ROWS THAT CAN FALL AFTER MIDNIGHT ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Ishāʾ and the First Third are printed on this card but can happen on the
 * next calendar day — Stockholm in June puts Ishāʾ past 00:00 — and a naive
 * "today at 00:15" is sixteen hours in the PAST, which would read as a day
 * already spent at breakfast. Both are pushed a day when they land before
 * Maghrib, which is the same rule the card's own progress rail uses.
