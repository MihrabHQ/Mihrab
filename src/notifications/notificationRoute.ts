/**
 * What a tapped notification opens — issue #27.
 *
 * ── THE FAULT THIS FIXES ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Reported as three bugs: the khatmah reminder, the ayah of the day and
 * the Log widget all opened the app and left you wherever you were last.
 * They are one fault. Every notification this app posts carries
 * `pressAction: { id: 'default' }`, which tells the system to open the
 * app, and NOTHING IN THE APP READ THE PRESS. The ayah of the day even
 * attaches its surah and ayah — the data was right, and no code ever
 * looked at it.
 *
 * So a notification's destination is a URL, resolved here, and handed to
 * the same deep-link machinery the widgets already use: `mihrab://…`,
 * parsed by src/navigation/linking.ts. Widgets and notifications then
 * reach a screen the same way, and there is one place that decides where
 * a tap goes.
 *
 * ── RESOLVED WHEN TAPPED, NOT WHEN SCHEDULED ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The khatmah reminder is written up to a week ahead, and its body names
 * a page — the page the plan was on at scheduling time. Baking that page
 * into the destination would send a reader who has since read on back to
 * where they were on Monday. So the notification carries only what it IS
 * (`route: 'khatmah'`), and where that leads is worked out at the moment
 * of the tap, from the plan as it stands. The ayah of the day is the
 * opposite case and is baked in: it is that day's ayah, and it does not
 * become a different one because the tap was late.
 *
 * ── UNKNOWN NOTIFICATIONS GO NOWHERE ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A null return means "open the app and change nothing", which is what
 * every other notification in the app does today. Adhan alerts, the
 * end-of-day log prompt and the fasting reminders have their own action
 * handling and are deliberately not routed here.
