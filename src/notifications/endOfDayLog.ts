/**
 * End-of-day "log all as complete" reminder — v2.8.5.
 *
 * Logging the day is otherwise five separate acts of bookkeeping performed
 * while you are trying to pray. Most nights the honest answer is "all five,
 * yes" — so once the day's prayers are behind you, a single notification
 * asks exactly that, and one tap answers it without opening the app.
 *
 * ── Why the date travels in the payload ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The prompt lands ten minutes after Isha, which in a Swedish summer is
 * near midnight. People sleep through it and answer in the morning, and a
 * handler that logged "today" would then credit the wrong day and leave
 * the real one blank — the exact failure the reminder exists to prevent.
 * So the notification carries the date it was scheduled FOR, and the
 * action writes to that date no matter when it is pressed. Answering
 * Tuesday's prompt on Wednesday logs Tuesday.
 *
 * Only unlogged prayers are filled in: a day where Asr was already marked
 * `missed` keeps that record. The button means "the rest went fine", not
 * "overwrite what I told you".
 *
 * ── And it does not ask a question already answered ───────────────────
 *
 * A day whose five prayers are all recorded gets no prompt. Being asked to
 * log a day you have just finished logging is the app failing to notice its
 * own record, and the fix is not to ask more quietly — it is not to ask.
 * The prompt is retired the moment the day completes (every journal write
 * calls `syncEndOfDayReminderForDay`) and restored if an entry is later
 * removed, because then the day genuinely is unfinished again.
