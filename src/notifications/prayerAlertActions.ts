/**
 * The buttons on a prayer alert — built in ONE place.
 *
 * They were built twice: once for the alert that fires at prayer time and
 * once for the copy a snooze re-fires. The two had already drifted — the
 * snoozed copy lost its "Log prayer" button, so snoozing a prayer quietly
 * cost you the ability to log it from the notification at all. One builder,
 * one drift-free answer.
 *
 * ── THE SNOOZE CHIPS SAY WHAT THEY DO ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They used to read "5" "10" "15" "30" — four bare numbers under a text
 * field labelled "Minutes", which is a puzzle rather than a control. They now
 * read "Snooze 5 min", and tapping one snoozes immediately: the free-form
 * field is gone, and with it the second tap on a send button that a wrist
 * cannot comfortably find.
 *
 * Free-form typing went for a second reason. `allowGeneratedReplies` defaults
 * to TRUE in notifee, so a watch could offer its own smart-reply chips on
 * this action — "Sure, on my way" lands in the input, parses to nothing, and
 * the old parser silently snoozed ten minutes the user never asked for.
 * Choices-only, generated replies off, and the parser matches the exact label
 * it generated before it ever falls back to digits.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE IS NO "STOP ADHAN" HERE ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `AdhanPlayer` is an iOS module — on Android every one of its methods is a
 * documented no-op, because there the adhan IS the channel sound. So the
 * Android button's only effect was cancelling the notification, which
 * swiping it away already does. It was spending one of the three slots
 * Android gives us to duplicate a swipe. iOS keeps its own Stop action,
 * declared on the category, where it does real work.
