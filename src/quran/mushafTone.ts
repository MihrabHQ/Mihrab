 * The tone of the page — what the paper is, before anything is drawn on it.

 * Three tones. Paper is the print: white, black ink, the dark-gold
 * ornament. Night is a repaint, not an inversion — near-black ground, a
 * warm off-white ink, a lighter gold — and has been here since 2.7. Sepia
 * sits between them: a warm paper with a dark brown ink, for reading in a
 * lit room where white glares and night is too little.
 *
 * ── WHY THE STORED SHAPE IS TWO FIELDS ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `mushafNightMode` has been a boolean in every stored blob since the
 * night page shipped, and every surface that reacts to it — the header
 * tint, the content colour, the chevrons, the sidebar — reads that
 * boolean. Sepia is a second, additive field that says which of the two
 * LIGHT tones the page takes when night is off; night keeps its boolean
 * and its meaning. Nothing already stored changes shape, and a downgrade
 * reads the old field exactly as before.
