/**
 * Turning the tajwīd colours on starts their download.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SWITCH, AND NOT A BUTTON ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The coloured pages are a second set of page fonts, and they arrive the
 * way the plain muṣḥaf's do: page by page as they are read, or all at once
 * from a row in Settings. The row was the only way to get the whole set,
 * and it was under a heading most people never open — so the colours were
 * switched on, the reader coloured the page it was on, and every page
 * turn after that waited on the network. The plain muṣḥaf does not work
 * like that: opening the reader the first time fetches the whole book
 * once, in the background, with a bar in the shade, and the pages fill in
 * as they land. The colours now do the same, and the switch is what asks.
 *
 * ── WHICH PALETTE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A font carries one palette, so light pages and dark pages are two sets
 * of ~170 MB. The one the muṣḥaf is drawn in now goes first. The other is
 * queued behind it only when the page tone is AUTO — following the app,
 * which follows the phone, so a reader on auto reads in both palettes
 * over a day and would be waiting on the network again at dusk. On a
 * fixed tone the other palette is a row in Settings, as it was.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES NOT DO ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not start on a plain muṣḥaf that is not yet on the device: the
 * reader's own gate owns that first download and the consent that goes
 * with it, and 180 MB of book comes before 170 MB of colour. It does not
 * start over a metered connection unless the person already chose to
 * read on one — the same rule as the resume watcher. And turning the
 * switch OFF cancels a colour download in flight, and forgets the one
 * queued behind it: the colours were asked for, and now they are not.
 *
 * Every switch in the app — Settings, the guide, the ayah sheet's
 * "show me" — goes through the same preference, so this watches the
 * preference rather than the switches.
