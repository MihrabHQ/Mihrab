/**
 * Turning a published riwayah dataset into a muṣḥaf — or refusing to.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS IN `src/` AND NOT IN `tools/` ─────────────────────────
 *
 * It began in `tools/riwayat/import.ts`, where a human ran it once and
 * looked at the output. That was the right place while the data was going
 * to be committed. It is the wrong place now: the app no longer ships any
 * riwayah data (`docs/design/riwayat-plan.md` §0), so the file that
 * becomes scripture on someone's phone is one THEIR device fetched, which
 * no maintainer will ever see.
 *
 * A check that only runs on the maintainer's laptop protects the
 * maintainer. So the checks live here, the CLI calls them, and the device
 * calls the same ones on whatever arrives before a single ayah of it is
 * drawn. Nothing becomes a muṣḥaf without passing through this function.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT REFUSES, AND WHY EACH ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Scripture is the one payload where "probably right" is not a state the
 * app may be in, so every check is fatal rather than a warning. A checksum
 * proves a file arrived intact; these prove it is a Qur'an:
 *
 *   • 6236 ayahs, 114 surahs, and every surah's exact count. A dataset
 *     missing an ayah is not a shorter Qur'an, it is a wrong one.
 *   • No duplicates, no gaps.
 *   • Every ayah has text. An empty string renders as a blank line that
 *     looks like layout, not like loss.
 *   • Page numbers never go backwards. This is the one that catches a
 *     dataset stitched together out of order — the failure that would look
 *     completely plausible on screen.
 *   • Every page has at least one ayah on it. A muṣḥaf with a page nobody
 *     is on is a broken import, not a blank page in the print.
 *
 * ── AND WHETHER IT IS THE QUR'AN AT ALL ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * This used to say that whether correct-shaped Arabic is the real thing
 * was a human's job. It was left at that, and the consequence turned up on
 * an emulator: a synthetic dataset — literally the words "test text, not
 * Qur'an" repeated 6236 times — passed every check here and rendered as a
 * muṣḥaf, with surah band, juz label, ayah medallions and page number.
 * Nothing on that screen told a reader what they were looking at.
 *
 * So the content is checked too, at the sixty places a reader would check
 * it themselves: the first and last ayah of each of the thirty ajzāʾ, read
 * against the Tanzil Hafs text this app already ships and hashes. See
 * `juzCheck.ts`. It is not a proof of authenticity and does not pretend to
 * be one — but nothing that is not the Qur'an gets past it, which is the
 * failure that actually happened.
