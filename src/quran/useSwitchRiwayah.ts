/**
 * CHANGING MUṢḤAF, IN ONE PLACE.
 *
 * Setting `prefs.riwayah` is not the whole of it. A `unicode` riwayah
 * starts and ends every page exactly where the printed one does, but its
 * LINES are laid out by the device rather than taken from the print —
 * someone who has memorised where an ayah sits on the page of their own
 * copy will notice, and finding out by being confused is the worst way to
 * learn it. So the first switch to one says so, once, and records that it
 * has (`riwayahNoticeSeen`).
 *
 * That lived inside the muṣḥaf screen while the reader's header was the
 * only way to switch. A second entry point — Settings → Qur'an — would
 * have set the preference without the notice AND without the flag, so the
 * alert would have gone off later, inside the reader, about a muṣḥaf the
 * reader had already been using for a week. Two callers is exactly when a
 * rule stops being a screen's business.
