 * What the page-image muṣḥaf left behind, and the one helper every store

 *
 * This module was the managed file store for the 604 page PNGs — manifest,
 * integrity sweep, the eight-worker downloader with its RN-fetch fallback
 * transport. The font-rendered reader replaced the images in 2.8.0 and the
 * image reader itself is gone now (docs/mushaf-reader-split-plan.md, step
 * 4), so what is left is:
 *
 *   • `mkdirDeep`, which every on-device store in the Quran module uses,
 *     because `fs.mkdir` is not recursive;
 *   • the retired image store's footprint, and the sweep that reclaims it.
 *     An app that has been UPDATED rather than freshly installed can still
 *     be carrying several hundred megabytes under <Documents>/quran/mushaf
 *     that nothing will ever read again. The download gate removes it
 *     before fetching the fonts, and the downloads screen lists it until
 *     it is gone.
