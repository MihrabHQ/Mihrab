 * The slot pool has room for it — 23 slots against at most six mounted
 * pages — and a slot claimed for a neighbour is unpinned, so it is the
 * first to be recycled if the pool ever fills. After interactions, not
 * during: a font parse on the main thread in the middle of the turn
 * animation is a dropped frame, and the whole point is smoothness.
