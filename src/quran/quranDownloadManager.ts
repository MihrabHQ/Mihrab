/**
 * The Quran's downloads, owned by the app rather than by a screen.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The mushaf download used to live inside MushafReader: the handle was a
 * ref, and the effect that created it cancelled it on cleanup. Which meant
 * leaving the Quran tab — or turning the phone, or switching to the text
 * reader — threw away however much of a six-hundred-page book had arrived.
 * The only way to finish was to sit and watch it, on a screen that exists
 * to be read rather than watched.
 *
 * A module holds it now. Screens ask what is happening and subscribe to
 * changes; nothing about mounting or unmounting starts or stops anything.
 * The only two things that end a download are finishing and being
 * cancelled, and cancelling is something a person does.
 *
 * ── WHY IT OWNS THE RECITATIONS TOO ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because the per-surah audio download had exactly the bug described
 * above, still: its handle lived in RecitationControls' component state
 * and died with the sheet. That was survivable for one surah of eighty
 * ayahs. A reciter's whole Quran is 6,236 files and over a gigabyte, and a
 * download that size cannot belong to a screen.
 *
 * ── ONE AT A TIME, ACROSS BOTH KINDS ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A second run started while the first is in flight would halve both and
 * confuse the progress — and that is as true of fonts against a recitation
 * as of fonts against fonts. They share one pipe, one disk and, on
 * Android, one foreground service: the notification IS the service, so two
 * downloads would either fight over one bar or need two services to say
 * one thing.
 *
 * So `start` is a no-op while anything is running, and the caller finds
 * out by reading the state it gets back. The alternative — a real queue,
 * with the second job waiting — was considered and is not worth it: these
 * are downloads people start deliberately, one at a time, and being told
 * "something is already downloading" is a better answer than silently
 * joining a queue whose progress bar is about something else.

 * screen that lists forty-two voices and has to say which one.

 * `surah` is one surah in one voice — the tilāwah download in the ayah
 * sheet. It is the small one, and it was the last to move in here: its
 * handle lived in `RecitationControls`, so closing the sheet threw it
 * away, and the shade never heard about it at all.
 *
 * `refs` are the ayahs to fetch — the MISSING ones, so the count on
 * screen is the work left rather than a walk to 286 that skips 282 of
 * them instantly. It is optional because a caller that only wants to ask
 * `isJobRunning` should not have to read the disk first; when it is
 * absent the whole surah is queued and the already-valid files are
 * skipped.
