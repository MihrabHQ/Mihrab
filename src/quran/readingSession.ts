/**
 * Whose reading this is — decided at the door, not by the page.
 *
 * A reader can keep several places in the book at once: a khatmah, a
 * surah read now and then, Al-Mulk every evening, a passage under
 * revision. The question every page turn has to answer is WHICH of them
 * just moved, and there are two ways to answer it.
 *
 * By position — the marker nearest the page claims the turn — is the
 * rule the khatmah already uses, and it works for the khatmah because
 * there is only one. With several following bookmarks it breaks in a way
 * that cannot be fixed: two of them a few pages apart, or one inside the
 * khatmah's pages, and the app has to guess. Sometimes it guesses wrong,
 * silently, about where somebody was — the worst failure a place-keeper
 * can have.
 *
 * By intent — whatever you OPENED owns the session — has no such
 * ambiguity, because you already said which reading this is by the door
 * you came in through. Open a following bookmark and it records the
 * turns; come in through the surah index and nothing does but the
 * ordinary marker, which is exactly what happened before any of this
 * existed. Overlap stops mattering: two bookmarks on one page are fine,
 * because you opened one of them.
 *
 * Position keeps one job, as a GUARD rather than the rule. Open the
 * revision bookmark in Al-Baqarah, then swipe fifty pages to look
 * something up in Al-Kahf, and the bookmark must not be dragged across
 * the book after you — `withinBookmarkReach` is what stops that. It does
 * not change whose visit it is: you opened that bookmark, it is still
 * where you come back to, and an excursion records nothing anywhere.
 * Handing such a turn to the marker is worse than recording nothing,
 * because the marker is the only record of a reading nobody bookmarked
 * and it would be overwritten by a glance.
 *
 * IN MEMORY ONLY. A session is a fact about this visit to the reader —
 * set when it opens, forgotten when it closes — so it is never stored
 * and never synced.
 *
 * THE KHATMAH IS A DOOR, AND HOW FAR IT REACHES. Read today's portion
 * having come in from the surah index and it counts, which is what the
 * reader asked for. But only from where the plan stands: a visit opened
 * anywhere but the khatmah's own door credits the plan on the page of its
 * next unread ayah and behind it, never ahead — reading ahead in the
 * portion is the khatmah's only when the khatmah was opened (#84;
 * `recordKhatmahPageTurn`). The khatmah owner is also the CHROME — the
 * done-marks beside the surah name belong to a khatmah reading and to
 * nothing else. Opening Al-Fatiha from the index, months into a plan, used
 * to put a green check in the header of a reading that had nothing to do
 * with the khatmah.
