/**
 * The four marks the recitation controls are made of.
 *
 * Drawn, not typed. A glyph like ▶︎ or ✕ is somebody else's artwork at
 * somebody else's weight: it lands at a different size and stroke on
 * every platform and Android skin, some of them render it in colour, and
 * none of them take the accent when the control is active. These are the
 * same 2pt round-capped strokes as the rest of the app's icons, and they
 * take a resolved hex — react-native-svg draws nothing at all when handed
 * a PlatformColor.
 *
 * Shared by the bar under the title bar and by the now-playing row on the
 * Qur'an page, so the same action is the same shape wherever it appears.
