/**
 * The recitation, carried on every screen that is not already showing it.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS UP HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Playback outlives the page it was started from. Someone begins a surah
 * in Tilawah, goes to look at tomorrow's Fajr, and the recitation is now
 * a thing happening to them with no control in reach — the only way to
 * pause was the notification shade or the walk back to Tilawah. So the
 * transport follows them: pause, stop, and a way back to the player, on
 * one line under the title bar, with the surah named on the other side
 * and its progress along the bottom edge.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT ON TWO SCREENS ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Tilawah IS the player and the reader carries the MiniPlayer over the
 * page. On either, this bar would be a second set of the same controls a
 * few centimetres from the first.
 *
 * ── WHY THE BAR IS THE SURAH, NOT THE AYAH ────────────────────────────
 *
 * An ayah is six seconds. A hairline that fills and empties every six
 * seconds is a flicker, not a progress bar. The surah is the thing being
 * listened to, so the surah is what the line measures — in ayahs, refined
 * by how far into the current one we are, because nothing knows how long
 * a surah runs until it has been played.

 * This wrapper is mounted on every screen of both navigators — six tabs,

 * `useProgress(500)` right here, and `useProgress` is a timeout loop
 * that asks the native player for its position every half-second for as
 * long as the hook is mounted, playing or not, focused or not. So an
 * idle app with nothing playing was making seven native calls every
 * five hundred milliseconds to draw a line that was not on screen.
 *
 * Now the wrapper subscribes to the playback store — a `useSyncExternal-
 * Store` read, free until something changes — and decides. The poller
 * lives in `LiveBar`, which exists on exactly one screen: the focused
 * one, while something is playing.
