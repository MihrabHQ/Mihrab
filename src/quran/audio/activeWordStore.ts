/**
 * The word being recited, as a store the page lines can subscribe to one
 * at a time.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT A PROP ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `useActiveWordIndex` polls playback four times a second and returns a
 * fresh object each time. Threaded down as a prop it would re-render the
 * reader, the list, every mounted page and every line at that rate, to
 * move a highlight one word along on one of them. The translation view
 * can afford that per card; a muṣḥaf page is ~250 drawn pieces and a
 * spread mounts six of them.
 *
 * So one probe component reads the hook and publishes here, and each
 * LINE subscribes with a selector that answers a single question — "which
 * of my words is being recited, if any" — as a number. React's
 * `useSyncExternalStore` compares the number, and a line whose answer has
 * not changed does not wake. Four ticks a second reach two lines, not
 * ninety.
