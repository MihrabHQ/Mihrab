/**
 * Playback orchestrator — QR-16/17/19 (docs/quran-reader-plan.md).
 *
 * Thin, typed layer over react-native-track-player:
 *
 *   • Builds per-ayah track queues (one EveryAyah MP3 per ayah, local
 *     file when downloaded, streaming URL otherwise).
 *   • Expands memorization repeats into the queue itself (each-ayah ×N,
 *     whole-range ×M) — no fragile mid-playback queue surgery.
 *   • Mirrors the active (surah, ayah) + playing state into a tiny
 *     external store so UI components subscribe without touching the
 *     player library directly (`usePlaybackStatus`).
 *
 * The player is set up lazily on first play — never at app startup.
