/**
 * Where an āyah sits down the page, so a scrolling column can follow the
 * recitation.
 *
 * ── WHY A COLUMN HAS TO FOLLOW AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * In portrait the page is height-fitted: every line is on screen, and the
 * highlight moving from line to line needs nothing from the reader. Turn
 * the phone and the column becomes a 1.6× reading zoom — deliberately
 * taller than the window — and the recitation walks off the bottom of it
 * within a few āyāt. Reported as the player "not following the word
 * highlight as it moves across the page", which is exactly what it looked
 * like: the highlight was moving, on a part of the page nobody could see.
 *
 * The unit is the LINE, not the word. A muṣḥaf line is horizontal, so a
 * word's position across it says nothing about how far down the page the
 * reciter has got; scrolling per word would jitter the page sideways-worth
 * of nothing fifteen times a line.
 *
 * Only the glyph renderer has a layout to answer from. A bundled riwayah
 * (`unicode`) flows its text and has no fixed lines, so this returns null
 * and the column stays where the reader put it.
