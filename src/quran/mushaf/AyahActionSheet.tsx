/**
 * Ayah action sheet — QR-8/9/12, unified in v2.7.28.
 *
 * Bottom sheet shown on long-pressing an ayah (mushaf page or
 * translation card). ONE panel for everything about the ayah:
 *
 *   • translation peek + real tafsir (on-demand, cached offline),
 *   • bookmark (five colors), star, khatmah "I am here" pin,
 *   • play from here / repeat / share (text or image card),
 *   • the full recitation controls (reciter, download, speed,
 *     memorization, range player) — the header "Recitation" button
 *     opens this same sheet scrolled straight to this section.
