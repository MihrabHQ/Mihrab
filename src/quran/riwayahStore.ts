 *
 * ── WHY THE DEVICE AND NOT THE BUNDLE ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The app shipped these files, briefly, as empty placeholders — because
 * Metro resolves `require()` at bundle time, so a riwayah's data had to
 * exist at a fixed path in every checkout whether or not it existed at
 * all. That was a workaround for a design that was wrong underneath it.
 *
 * Mihrab does not have the right to distribute the Warsh corpus. QUL's
 * resources state no licence, its credits name KFGQPC and Tanzil, and
 * nobody publishes a Warsh text under terms anyone can point at (looked,
 * September 2026: Tanzil is Hafs only, alquran.cloud has no Warsh
 * edition, DigitalKhatt is Hafs, ITQAN's catalogue states no licences at
 * all). Asking is one route. The other is not to distribute it: the app
 * ships a reader, the reader obtains the muṣḥaf from whoever publishes
 * it, and it arrives here — on their device, from the publisher, without
 * Mihrab ever holding a copy or standing in the chain.
 *
 * `source.json` is not bookkeeping. It records where a file came from and
 * when, because a muṣḥaf whose provenance nobody can state is exactly the
 * thing this design exists to avoid, and the reader is entitled to see
 * the answer on the screen that offers to delete it.
