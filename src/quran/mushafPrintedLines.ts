/**
 * The printed line, for a riwayah whose text carries no line assignment.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `MushafUnicodePage` reflows: it fits a font size to the box and lets the
 * text wrap where it will. On a phone that gave thirteen lines where the
 * print has fifteen, breaks falling nowhere near the printed ones, and a
 * third of the page empty underneath. A muṣḥaf whose lines are not the
 * muṣḥaf's lines is a different book to anyone who has memorised from one.
 *
 * The Hafs pages solve this with a per-page font whose every line is a
 * given: `mushafLayoutV2.json` says which glyphs are on which line. No
 * such table is published for Warsh, and the text export has no
 * `line_number` in it.
 *
 * What IS published, CC0, is a polygon per ayah per page
 * (`quranpedia/quran-svg`) — and a polygon is a statement about lines: it
 * says which rows of the page an ayah occupies and how much of each. That
 * is not word-level, but it is ayah-level, and ayah-level is what a reader
 * sees. `tools/qiraat/lines.py` reduces those polygons to this table.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS EXACT HERE, AND WHAT IS NOT ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Exact: how many lines a page has, which ayahs are on each line, and in
 * what order — including the rows a surah band takes, which appear as
 * lines with nothing on them.
 *
 * Not exact: where the break falls INSIDE an ayah that spans two lines.
 * The table says an ayah takes 73% of one line and 27% of the next; this
 * splits its words to match that ratio. With the printed face those two
 * would be the same thing. With a substituted face they are close, and
 * the alternative — pretending the whole page is a paragraph — is not
 * close at all.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT IS BUNDLED ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The app ships no riwayah TEXT: it has no right to pass scripture on, and
 * `riwayahStore.ts` has that argument in full. This is not text. It is a
 * table of line counts and widths, meaningless without a muṣḥaf to lay
 * out, CC0 where the polygons are, and 31 KB in the shipped APK. Keeping
 * it out would mean a second download to make the first one legible.
