/**
 * Phone mushaf reader — both orientations, one component
 * (docs/mushaf-reader-split-plan.md, step 2).
 *
 * Grown from `MushafPhoneLandscape`'s FlatList: portrait and landscape are
 * the SAME tree, so rotation never remounts — it only re-derives the page
 * geometry from `useWindowDimensions` (see `phonePageGeometry.ts`):
 *
 * - `pageWidth` = window width (both orientations)
 * - `textWidth` = portrait: width − padding · landscape:
 *   `min(width − padding, height × 1.6)` (the reading zoom — the short
 *   side IS the portrait page width)
 * - the page column scrolls vertically only when the page is taller than
 *   the window (portrait: never — the page is height-fitted so
 *   `lineHeight = available height / lineCount`; landscape: always).
 *
 * The FlatList keeps its index across rotation; `getItemLayout` recomputes
 * from the new width. No zoom clamps, no windowed strip, no image-cache
 * math — this component is only ever mounted on a phone (DEVICE_CLASS,
 * answered once at module scope) in text mode.
 *
 * ── WHAT A PAGE IS ALLOWED TO RE-RENDER FOR ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The list re-renders for every reason the reader does — a turn, a recited
 * ayah, the chrome coming or going, the player appearing — and each of
 * those used to reach every mounted page: `renderItem` closed over the
 * whole core and the current page, so it was a new function every render,
 * and a page's props carried things that belonged to other pages (the
 * playing ayah, the selection) and so changed when THEY changed.
 *
 * A page is a memoised component now, and it is handed only what is its
 * own: the settled geometry, the marks, and the selection, the playing
 * ayah and the finish pill only when they are on it. Everything else on
 * the screen can re-render and the page does not notice.

 * ── WHY IT ONCE HELD ONE PAGE AT REST, AND WHY IT NO LONGER NEEDS TO ──
 *
 * The window used to drop back to the page being read whenever the pager
 * had been still for a few seconds, and widen to three again when a finger
 * landed. The reason was rotation: the platform resizes the pager before
 * any of our code runs, and the frame it composed under its rotation fade
 * showed the current page and its waiting neighbour side by side. With no
 * neighbour mounted there was nothing to reveal.
 *
 * Since then the window is covered at the turn itself, natively — Android
 * raises the cover in `onConfigurationChanged`, before the window draws at
 * the new size, and iOS in `viewWillTransition` (RotationCover, and see
 * `rotationFade.ts`) — so that frame is never on screen whatever is
 * mounted behind it.
 *
 * And the price of the narrow window was paid on every page turn that
 * came after a pause, which is most of them in recitation (#72): the touch
 * that started the swipe was also what began drawing the two neighbours —
 * a typeface each and ~150 lines of text — on the same thread the drag
 * needed. The first page of every turn stuttered. So now the neighbours,
 * two each side, are drawn once the opening is over and stay drawn: the
 * page the finger pulls in is already there, and so is the one after it
 * for a reader turning quickly.
 *
 * The opening still draws only the page being opened — its font and
 * fifteen lines should not share the push transition with four more.
