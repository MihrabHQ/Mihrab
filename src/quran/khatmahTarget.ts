/**
 * Where a khatmah continues — one answer, for everything that offers to
 * take the reader there.
 *
 * The widget's Continue card and the khatmah reminder are the same
 * promise made on two surfaces: "your portion is here, tap to carry on".
 * They resolved it separately — the widget from `khatmahCurrentPage` and
 * the muṣḥaf page table, the notification from nothing at all, since
 * tapping it did not go anywhere (#27) — and two resolutions of one
 * promise is how a widget and a notification come to disagree about which
 * ayah the reader is on.
 *
 * THE PLAN'S PAGE, NOT THE LAST PAGE LOOKED AT. A reader who browsed
 * somewhere else after finishing today's portion has a last-read position
 * that has nothing to do with the khatmah; the offer is about the plan, so
 * it is the plan's own page that answers.
