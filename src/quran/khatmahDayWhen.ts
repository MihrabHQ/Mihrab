/**
 * When a khatmah day's reading is due, said the way a person would.
 *
 * "Finish day 5" is a number out of a plan, and a plan's day numbers are
 * only meaningful next to a calendar. The button asks you to finish a
 * day's reading without ever saying which day that is, so a reader who
 * has lost count of where they are cannot tell from it whether they are
 * on schedule, a day ahead, or a week behind.
 *
 * A plan's day N is due N-1 days after it began. That is the whole
 * arithmetic; the rest is deciding what to call the answer.
 *
 * Anything already due — today or earlier — is "today", because that is
 * what it means for the reader: it is the reading in front of them now.
 * Naming the Monday of a week they have fallen behind would be accurate
 * and useless. Tomorrow gets its own word; the next few days get their
 * weekday, which is how people talk about the week ahead; and beyond
 * that a date, because "Thursday" three weeks out is not a date anyone
 * can place.
