/**
 * What the Quran doors say — on Home's card and at the top of the Qur'an
 * tab, which draw the same thing (design review 2b; issue #41).
 *
 * The card used to be one wide button reading "Open the Quran" — an
 * unfalsifiable label on the widest element of the screen, while the app
 * already knew the last page, the khatmah plan and today's portion and
 * surfaced none of it. It became four states, and the four had one flaw:
 * they were EITHER a khatmah OR a place to continue reading, and a reader
 * who keeps a khatmah and reads Al-Kahf on Fridays has two places to go
 * back to, not one. With a plan running the card said "Continue" and
 * opened the last page looked at, which was sometimes the plan and
 * sometimes not, and never said which.
 *
 * So: two doors, each present when it is true, each leading exactly where
 * it says.
 *
 *   khatmah — a plan is running: its day, what is left today or that it
 *             is done, and the plan's OWN next page (`khatmahContinueTarget`
 *             — never the last page looked at).
 *   reading — the reading marker (`quranState.lastRead`), unless it is
 *             riding with the plan, in which case the khatmah door already
 *             leads there and a second door to the same page is noise
 *             (`readingContinueTarget`).
 *
 * Neither is the "start" state: the way into the muṣḥaf and the offer of a
 * khatmah. It used to show the verse of the day there; that is a reading,
 * and Today is not where one is read — the card's job is the way in.
 *
 * A selector and not branches inside the view, as the review's own note
 * asks: the states belong somewhere testable, and two screens draw them.
