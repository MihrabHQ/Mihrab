   * A bookmark IS a kept place, so a second marker trailing the same

   *
   * So neither following mode matters here. A following bookmark walks
   * with the reading; a fixed one stays where it was pinned; and in both
   * cases the marker is left alone, because in both cases the place is
   * already kept by the thing that was opened.
   *
   * Reading away from it records NOTHING, which is the honest answer:
   * someone who swipes off to look something up has not started a
   * reading anywhere, and the bookmark is not dragged after them
   * (`withinBookmarkReach`). To keep a place out there, open it from the

/**
 * Is the reading in front of the reader the khatmah's own reading?
 *
 * A khatmah is a promise about ONE trail through the muṣḥaf, and the
 * reader has every other reason to be somewhere else in it: a bookmark,
 * a juz they wanted to hear, Al-Kahf on a Friday, the surah a search
 * landed on. Progress used to be credited from wherever the pages were
 * turning, so an evening in juz 30 could carry a plan sitting at page 50
 * to page 590 — six hundred pages the reader never read, and no way back
 * to the real place except by hand.
 *
 * The test is the trail, not the button that opened the reader. A page at
 * or behind the plan's own next page IS the khatmah — that is what
 * "Continue" hands you, and what a bookmark on the same page means too.
 * A page ahead of it is not, however the reader got there, and reading
 * there leaves the plan exactly where it was.
 *
 * Which leaves two ways to take the plan somewhere else on purpose, both
 * of them explicit and neither of them gated by this: pinning a position
 * from an ayah's own panel (`setKhatmahPosition` — the frontier becomes
 * the pinned page, so reading from there counts immediately), and marking
 * the portion read (`finishKhatmahPortion` — the frontier moves to the
 * start of the next one). Reading is what has to prove it belongs; saying
 * so out loud does not.
 *
 * ── AND A FEW PAGES AHEAD IS STILL THE SAME TRAIL — #44, second round ─
 *
 * The test above was `page <= frontier` exactly, and that is a hair
 * trigger: the plan's frontier sits ON the page the reader is turning
 * from, every single turn, so there is no slack in it anywhere. Get one
 * page ahead — by ANY means, and the ordinary ones are enough: open the
 * reader at a page, follow a link, let a fast flick settle somewhere the
 * pager corrected — and this said no to that turn, and then to every turn
 * after it, because each one starts from a page further ahead than the
 * last. The plan stopped moving for the rest of the session while the
 * pages kept turning, with nothing on screen to say why. That is the
 * second half of #44: the crossing was fixed and the hair trigger was
 * not, and it was reported back as "works for about six swipes, then it
 * blocks again".
 *
 * So the trail has a width. A page within ten pages of
 * the frontier is the plan's own reading and the turn from it counts —
 * which credits the pages in between, because a high-water mark is the
 * only shape progress has here. That is the trade: skip five pages on
 * purpose and read on, and the plan will count those five. A hizb is the
 * most it can ever be wrong by, it is wrong in the direction the reader
 * can see and correct, and it cannot be wrong silently for ever.
 *
 * Beyond that width nothing changes: juz 30 on a Friday is four hundred
 * pages from a plan sitting at page 50, a bookmark across the muṣḥaf is
 * hundreds, and both are still refused.
 */
/**
 * WHAT READING CAN COUNT RIGHT NOW — the plan's own rule, in ayahs.
 *
 * A page read inside today's portion counts, however the reader arrived:
 * another session, the index, a surah opened for its own sake. Reading
 * that belongs to a FUTURE day does not — it has not been earned, and
 * counting it would let a plan be finished out of order without ever
 * having read what lies between.
 *
 * With one exception, which is the same principle rather than a hole in
 * it: once today's portion is finished, reading on into the next one
 * counts too. Reading ahead is still reading, and a reader who has done
 * their day and carries on should not be told it did not happen.
 *
 * This replaces the ten-page slack, which approximated the same
 * idea with distance — ten pages either side of the frontier, chosen
 * because a high-water mark had to count everything in between and ten
 * was the most it could be wrong by. A set of pages read has no such
 * cost, so the window can be what it always should have been: the
 * portion.

 * inferring intent from page turns and must not bank a future day off a

 * they have read, which is the same standing `finishKhatmahPortion` and
 * `setKhatmahPosition` already have: "reading is what has to prove it
 * belongs; saying so out loud does not".
 *
 * So this is also the way out of a wrong count in either direction —
 * pages the plan credited that you had not read, and pages you read
 * somewhere it could not see.
 *
 * Unmarking is what the old shape could never do. A high-water mark can
 * only be wound back to a point, taking everything after it along; a set

 * looks stuck, silently — the same stall as issue #44, by another route.
 *
 * So the window takes the FURTHEST ayah read (`highestCovered`) as the
 * reader's position and ends at the end of the portion that follows it.
 * Reading on is credited while the hole stays open; the hole is reported
 * separately and can be gone to (`khatmahGap`), rather than quietly
 * taxing every day after it.
 *
 * It still refuses al-Kahf to a plan in Aal-Imran, which is the whole
 * point of having a window: reach is where the reader has BEEN, and a
 * page fifty portions ahead of that is not a page they have read.
 *

 *
 * It was, and it contradicted the line beside it. The day NUMBER comes
 * from the portion the reader has reached — that is the whole point of
 * the portion model, so that reading ahead or falling behind moves the
 * reader and not the schedule — while the days left came from midnights
 * elapsed since the plan started. On a plan begun today and read four
 * portions into, the card said "day 4 of 30" and "30 days left" in the
 * same breath.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT IS NOT THE DAY'S PORTION EITHER ────────────────────────
 *
 * Because that is pinned, on purpose. `khatmahDay` reports the portion
 * the day STARTED in, so that finishing it and reading on leaves the day
 * showing as done rather than silently becoming a new unfinished one —
 * and a reader who sat down at page 90 and read to page 551 is still on
 * "day 5" until tomorrow, which is what was asked for.
 *
 * What is left of the BOOK is a different question, and its answer is
 * where the reader actually is. Saying "25 days to go" to someone with
 * fifty pages in front of them is the same fault in another place.

 * unit — "four pages left today" is a thing anyone can picture where
 * "sixty-one ayahs" is not. But the four pages are four pages OF SOMETHING,
 * and Warsh, Qālūn and Shuʿbah each break the text across their fifteen
 * lines differently. Answering out of the Ḥafṣ pagination for a reader in
 * Shuʿbah is quietly wrong by a page here and there all the way down the
 * book.
 *
 * So the ayahs are converted through the pagination of the muṣḥaf in
 * hand. `pagesForRiwayah` falls back to Ḥafṣ for a riwayah this build
 * cannot draw, which is the right way to be wrong: that reader is in
