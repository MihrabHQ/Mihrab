 * A pulsing dot beside the surah name: this reading is being kept, and
 * the colour says WHICH of the three trails is keeping it.
 *
 * A following bookmark used to say so by washing an ayah — and since it
 * moves with the reading, the ayah it washed was the first one on
 * whatever page you had reached. That reads as "you bookmarked this
 * line", which is not what happened and not something the reader did.
 * The mark belonged to the session, not to an ayah, so it moved to where
 * sessions belong: the chrome, next to the name of what you are reading.
 *
 * It pulses because it is live. A still dot in a bookmark colour is
 * indistinguishable from a decoration; a slow breath is the one thing on
 * this page that says "and it is recording".

 * design — and it left the marker as the one trail that could overwrite
 * your place without anything on screen having said it was recording.
 *
 * So the dot is the visit's owner in that owner's own ink: the
 * bookmark's colour, the khatmah's, or the marker's. It answers "what is
 * this reading counting towards" at a glance, always, instead of only
 * when a bookmark happens to be the answer.
 *
 * It is the OWNER, not a forecast of what this particular page will
 * move. The khatmah's ±2 veto and the bookmark's ±3 detach are guards on
 * individual turns, and a dot that flickered as you crossed them would
 * be describing the machinery rather than the reading.
