/**
 * Whether the page in hand is one the khatmah has read.
 *
 * A hollow amber ring for a page still to read, a filled green check once
 * it is done — beside the surah name, where the session dot sits, in and
 * out of fullscreen. Only while a plan is live: with no khatmah there is
 * no such thing as a page being done, and the mark would be answering a
 * question nobody asked.
 *
 * It exists because crediting is otherwise silent. The plan counts pages
 * as you read them and says so nowhere, so a reader a portion ahead of
 * themselves cannot tell that nothing is counting, and one reading inside
 * today's portion cannot tell that it is. This is that fact, on screen,
 * for the page under the thumb.
 *
 * Not a pulse. The session dot breathes because it is recording as you
 * watch; this is a state, and a state that blinks is an alarm.
