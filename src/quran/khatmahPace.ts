/**
 * TWO WAYS TO PACE A KHATMAH, and the arithmetic for the second one.
 *
 * A plan has always been a DURATION: "finish in thirty days", cut into
 * thirty equal portions when it is made, and the day number is the
 * reader's — the portion they have reached — never the calendar's. That
 * is the right model for someone who wants a rhythm, and nothing here
 * changes it.
 *
 * Issue #53 asks for the other one: "finish by the 30th". A DEADLINE is a
 * promise about a date, so the day number IS the calendar's, and the cut
 * cannot be made once and left: miss a day and what remains has one fewer
 * day to fit into. So the book is re-cut every day — what is still unread
 * over the days that are still left — and the reader is told the new
 * number rather than the count of days they missed.
 *
 * ── WHY THE DAY'S CUT IS PINNED AND NOT RECOMPUTED ────────────────────
 *
 * `unread / daysLeft` is the pace, but it cannot be asked twice in one
 * day. Read `r` of today's portion and the remainder falls to `unread-r`,
 * so the quota falls to `(unread-r)/D`, and what is left of today becomes
 * `(unread-r)/D` again — a day that recedes as you walk towards it, and
 * never ends. The cut is therefore taken ONCE, when the day opens, and
 * held for that day (`KhatmahPace`). Tomorrow asks again.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT IS STORED RATHER THAN DERIVED ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious pin is `dayStartAyahsRead`, which already records where
 * this device stood when the day began. It is deliberately NOT synced
 * (docs/sync-conflict-rules.md): it is a fact about one device's morning.
 * Two devices that first opened the app at different hours today would
 * pin different starting points and show different quotas for the same
 * day — the plan saying "14 pages today" on the phone and "9 pages today"
 * on the Mac. So a deadline plan keeps its own cut, and that one travels.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: the plan's fields in, numbers out. The writer
 * that pins the cut lives with the other khatmah writers in
 * `quranState.ts`, and the plan-shaped wrappers with the rest of the
 * portion maths in `khatmahSchedule.ts`.

 * ── IN PAGES, LIKE EVERY OTHER CUT IN THIS APP ────────────────────────
 *
 * An ayah is not a unit of reading. The first pages of al-Baqarah carry
 * six or seven long ones and the last juz carries forty short ones, so a
 * quota of "208 ayahs a day" is thirty-one pages in one place and
 * fourteen in another — the reader would be handed a different day's work
 * every morning without moving the pace at all. The duration plan cuts by
 * Ḥafṣ pages for exactly this reason (`portionEnd`), and so does this: a
 * whole number of pages, the same number wherever in the book they fall,
 * ending where a page ends.
 *
 * It runs FORWARD from where the reader is, because that is what
 * "continue" means — but the quota counts the backlog too
 * (`unreadPages` includes pages skipped behind them), so a plan with
 * holes in it asks for the pace that actually finishes the book. The
 * holes themselves are reported where they always were, by `khatmahGap`,
 * which offers to take the reader back to them.
