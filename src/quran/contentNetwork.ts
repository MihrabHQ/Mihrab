/**
 * Deadlines for the Quran content sources.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The prayer-times providers all reach the network through one hardened
 * helper (`src/utils/fetchWithRetry.ts`): timeout, retry policy, jittered
 * backoff, `Retry-After`, circuit breaker. The Quran content sources —
 * recitation MP3s, word timings, page fonts, tafsir, reader-supplied
 * riwayah datasets — grew up separately and never adopted it. Each one
 * hand-rolled its own retry loop, or none at all, and between them they
 * left every request without a deadline.
 *
 * That is worse than it sounds, because of how the transport is chosen.
 * The audio and font stores condemn `ReactNativeBlobUtil`'s streaming
 * downloader for the rest of the session on its first failure and fall
 * back to RN's own `fetch` — and the fallback was the one path with no
 * timeout at all. So the very networks that break the streaming transport
 * (a captive portal, a corporate proxy, a connection that is accepted and
 * then stalls) are exactly the networks that routed every subsequent
 * request onto a promise that can never settle. A reader on hotel wifi
 * got a spinner with no end and no error.
 *
 * Two rules follow, and this file holds both so a sixth content source
 * cannot quietly invent a third answer:
 *
 *   1. Every request has a deadline, named here rather than spelled as a
 *      number at the call site.
 *   2. A deadline is not a retry. These sources already carry their own
 *      attempt loops; adding `fetchWithRetry`'s would multiply them (three
 *      attempts becoming twelve) and turn one stalled ayah into four
 *      minutes. `fetchContentOnce` therefore fixes `maxAttempts: 1` and
 *      leaves the retrying to the caller that already does it.
 *
 * `__tests__/quranContentDeadlines.test.ts` fails if a file under
 * `src/quran/` calls `fetch(` or a blob-util `.fetch('GET', …)` without
 * going through one of these.

/**
 * How long each kind of content may take before it is a failure.
 *
 * Sized by what is on the wire and who is waiting, not by one blanket
 * number: a reader watching an ayah action sheet should be told the
 * tafsir is unavailable in a few seconds, while a 1.4 MB timings file on
 * a slow connection deserves a minute before anyone gives up on it.

/**
 * HOW A DOWNLOAD ENDED — issue #55.
 *
 * A queue of six thousand files has three endings, not two, and the app
 * used to have a word for only one of them. `complete` is every file on
 * disk. The other two both leave files missing, and they are nothing
 * alike:
 *
 *   • a handful of files would not come — a 404, a corrupt body, a
 *     stretch of bad luck — and the rest of the book arrived. There is
 *     something to report and nothing to wait for.
 *
 *   • the files stopped arriving ALTOGETHER, which is what a connection
 *     going away looks like from inside a queue. Nothing is wrong with
 *     the download; the network is gone, and it will be back.
 *
 * Telling the second one "failed" is the report in issue #55: a reader
 * whose wifi dropped at 85% was shown a failure, and the only button
 * their reciter had left was Delete. Every byte was still on disk.
 *
 * So a run says which ending it had, and `interrupted` is the one that
 * means "come back to this" — see `quranDownloadManager`, which is what
 * comes back to it.

 * whose wifi drops stops within seconds rather than grinding through six
 * thousand doomed fetches — each of which costs up to three attempts and
 * a 60-second deadline — and large enough that a few scattered bad files
