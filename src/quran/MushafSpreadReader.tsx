/**
 * Spread mushaf reader — large screens only: iPad, Mac Catalyst, large
 * foldables (docs/mushaf-reader-split-plan.md, step 3).
 *
 * Each FlatList ITEM is a whole spread — pages paired RTL, odd page on the
 * right, even on the left, (1,2) forming the decorative opening spread
 * exactly as the printed Madinah mushaf does (see `spreadForPage` in
 * mushafSpread.ts). Because the pair IS the item, "skips a page" cannot be
 * expressed: the FlatList index is the spread index, and a `pagingEnabled`
 * snap lands on nothing else.
 *
 * No zoom concept: a spread is width-fit, height-capped, centred. The one
 * internal branch: a portrait window (iPad portrait) shows a single
 * centred page per item instead of a pair. A Catalyst window resize
 * re-derives everything from `useWindowDimensions` — and re-pairs —
 * without losing the current page.
