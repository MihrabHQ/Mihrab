 *
 * Twenty of the fonts on the release were cut from a word list that lacked

 * 592 lost an ayah to "هي يج يح يخ يم يى" (reported 2026-09-03, with
 * screenshots). The fonts were replaced on the release — but a device that
 * had already fetched them held the bad ones, at the right name and a
 * plausible size, and nothing would ever fetch them again.
 *
 * So a font is the right font only when its size is the manifest's. A
 * mismatch is STALE: present for the gate's purposes (the muṣḥaf is on the
 * device, nobody is asked for 180 MB), fetched again before it is drawn.
 * Sizes are what a directory listing returns in one round-trip; a hash
