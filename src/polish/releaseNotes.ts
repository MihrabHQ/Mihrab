/**
 * Which releases to show a reader, and in which language.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS REPLACED ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `whatsNew.ts` held a hand-written table of one-to-three slides per
 * release and a rule that a release with no slides showed nothing. Two
 * releases ever got slides, so "nothing" was the answer for fifty-six of
 * them, and the surface could only ever be as complete as somebody's
 * memory on release day.
 *
 * The notes the stores get are written for every release without fail —
 * `release.sh` will not cut a tag without them — so they are the table
 * now, joined to version names and dates in `releaseNotes.generated.ts`.
 * What is left here is the part that is still a decision: which of those
 * releases this particular reader has not seen, and which language to
 * read them in.
 *
 * ── THE RULES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. **Never on a fresh install.** `lastSeenVersion` absent means the
 *     user has just been through setup; release notes for a version they
 *     have never not had are nonsense.
 *  2. **Everything since, not just the last one.** Someone who skipped
 *     three releases is told about all three, newest first.
 *  3. **A release with no note shows nothing** — and cannot happen for a
 *     tagged release, but can for a build made between releases.
 *  4. **The whole history is always there**, under whatever is new, and
 *     from Settings when nothing is new at all.
