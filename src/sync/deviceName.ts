 * so it travels in the envelope header — in the clear, because it has to be
 * readable before the receiving device has any reason to trust the sender.
 *
 * IT IS A LABEL, NEVER AN IDENTITY. Two devices may claim the same name and
 * nothing breaks; the public key is the identity and the name is decoration
 * on top of it. Nothing anywhere may key off it.
 *
 * The user can change it, and until they do it is the platform's word for
 * what this thing is. "iPad" is a better first guess than "Device 2", and a
 * worse one than what its owner would have typed — which is why the field
 * exists.
