/**
 * The half of the snapshot that touches disk.
 *
 * `snapshot.ts` and `merge.ts` are pure so they can be tested exhaustively
 * without a device; this is the thin, boring layer that reads the six stores
 * and writes the result back. Keeping it thin is the point — every decision
 * worth arguing about lives next door, and this file should never need one.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: the prayer-times cache, the city registry,
 * provider health, the reverse-geocode cache, the dataset caches, the
 * install date, the muted-adhan flag, the feature-tour flag, and every
 * downloaded mushaf page, font, recitation and tafsir file. Those are either
 * derived (they rebuild themselves), device-local (they describe THIS phone,
 * not the user), or enormous. Carrying `mihrab.first_seen_day` across would
 * be actively wrong: the Log's "fill in earlier days" button uses it as the
 * earliest day it may offer, so importing it would let a phone claim days it
 * never saw.
