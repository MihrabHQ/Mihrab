/**
 * How two devices' records become one.
 *
 * Every rule here is a union, a max, or a newest-wins on a timestamp the
 * writer had already stored before any of this existed. That is not a style
 * choice — it is what buys the three properties a serverless peer-to-peer
 * cycle needs:
 *
 *   COMMUTATIVE   merge(a,b) == merge(b,a)   — no "primary" device
 *   IDEMPOTENT    merge(a,a) == a            — re-import, re-sync, no drift
 *   ASSOCIATIVE   order of pairings is free  — A→B→C == A→C→B
 *
 * Get those and phones can sync in any order, over any transport, as often
 * as they like, with no coordination and no agreement about whose clock is
 * right. Lose any one of them and you need a server to arbitrate, which this
 * app does not have and should not want.
 *
 * IT USED TO COST EVERY DELETION. "Nothing is ever deleted" stood here for
 * a year, and it was a real trade at the time: the alternative is tombstones
 * and a rule for whose removal wins, and the failure mode of getting THAT
 * wrong is a month of someone's prayers disappearing. A resurrected bookmark
 * is an annoyance; a deleted record is the product failing at the only thing
 * it is for.
 *
 * What changed is that the annoyance turned out to have teeth. A khatmah pin
 * that came back did not just reappear — it dragged the plan's own "continue
 * here" back to a page the reader had finished with (`positionAt`), and an
 * un-marked page came back every round for ninety days. So removals travel
 * now, and they are the same shape everywhere: a REMOVAL IS A DATED FACT,
 * and it only ever buries a row older than itself. That keeps the three
 * properties above — a date is a max like any other — and it keeps the old
 * fear at arm's length, because no rule here can remove a record that was
 * written after the removal was made. Every tombstone is pruned at ninety
 * days, by which time it has reached every device or the device is gone.
 * docs/sync-conflict-rules.md has the inventory and the two places left
 * without one, with the reasons.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE ASYMMETRY. The khatmah's day baseline — `dayStartDate` and
 * the two numbers beside it — is not synced state at all: it answers "how
 * much has happened since MY day began", on this device's clock and this
 * device's calendar day. It is kept from the LOCAL side, so merging is not
 * symmetric in those three fields on purpose. Everything that travels is
 * still commutative.
