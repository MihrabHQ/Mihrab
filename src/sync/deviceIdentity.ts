/**
 * This device's identity for sync: one X25519 keypair, generated once.

 * ── THE SECRET HALF NEVER LEAVES ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It lives in `EncryptedStorage`, which is the Android Keystore and the iOS
 * Keychain — the same place the journal's at-rest key lives, and for the same
 * reason. It is not in the export file, it is not in the snapshot, it is not
 * in a backup, and there is no function here that returns it to a caller who
 * did not already have to reach into this module.
 *
 * This is the distinction the whole design turns on: the AT-REST key is
 * device-bound and stays that way, and sharing it across devices would make
 * every device only as strong as the weakest place it had ever been. What
 * travels is the PUBLIC half, and it travels as a pairing code the user can
 * read off a screen.
 *
 * ── WHY THE KEYPAIR IS DERIVED, NOT GENERATED ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `nacl.box.keyPair()` needs tweetnacl's PRNG, which React Native cannot
 * provide without a blocking bridge call on every use. `fromSecretKey` needs
 * none: we ask the platform for 32 secure bytes, hand them over, and get the
 * same keypair with no PRNG involved. See `secureRandom.ts`.
