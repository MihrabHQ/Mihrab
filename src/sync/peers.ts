/**
 * The devices this one syncs with: who they are, how they got here, and
 * why the list never leaves the phone it was made on.
 *
 * ── THIS LIST MUST NOT TRAVEL ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is the one piece of sync state that is emphatically NOT part of the
 * snapshot, and the reason is not privacy — it is that pairing would become
 * transitive by accident. Snapshots get exported to a file, and files get
 * sent to people: a friend who imports your export to look at the format
 * would silently join your device set, and your next sync would seal a copy
 * of your journal to their key. Pairing is a decision someone makes by
 * carrying a code, once, per device. Nothing else may create it.
 *
 * `syncCompleteness.test.ts` enforces that, and the reason is recorded there
 * alongside the reason the secret key stays.
 *
 * ── TWO WAYS IN, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ────────────────────────────
 *
 * A peer arrives either because the user typed its code here (`via: 'code'`)
 * or because it wrote a file that named itself (`via: 'announced'`). The
 * second is what makes one code produce two-way sync — see `envelope.ts` —
 * and it is a weaker claim: it proves only that the sender had this device's
 * code, which is public by design — and in fact sits in the clear in every
 * file in the folder, as the recipient of each sealed key. So an announced
 * device is NOT trusted on arrival. It is kept as `pending`: nothing is
 * sealed to it and nothing from it is merged until the user accepts it on
 * the Sync screen, having compared its fingerprint with the one the other
 * device shows. Until then, anyone with write access to the folder gets a
 * row on a screen and nothing else. (Reported privately against 91cabca0:
 * before this, write access to the folder was read access to the record.)
