/**
 * A change to the record schedules a sync. Every change, from anywhere.
 *
 * Auto-sync used to run when the app came forward and on a timer while it
 * stayed open, which misses the two moments most worth catching: logging a
 * prayer from the notification, and logging one from a widget. Both happen
 * with the app closed, both are exactly the edit someone wants on their
 * other device, and both used to sit on disk until the app was next opened.
 *
 * ── HOOKED AT THE STORE, NOT AT THE CALLERS ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Twelve places write these four keys today — two screens, three
 * notification paths, the practice store, the widget queues, and the merge
 * itself — and the thirteenth would have been added without a sync. So the
 * signal comes from `durableEncryptedSet`, which every one of them goes
 * through, and the decision about which keys count lives here.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NOT A CHANGE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Prayer times are computed, not recorded: a new day's schedule, a
 * refreshed provider window, a widget payload. None of it is anything the
 * user did, none of it differs between two devices that agree on a
 * location, and syncing on it would mean a round every time a day rolled
 * over on a phone in a drawer. Only the four stores that hold what someone
 * has actually done are listed below.
 *
 * ── AND A MERGE MUST NOT TRIGGER A MERGE ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * `applySnapshot` writes all four keys. Without the suppression below,
 * every round would end by scheduling another one, for ever, across every
 * paired device — each one's write waking the next. That is the whole
 * reason this is a suppressible signal rather than a plain listener.
