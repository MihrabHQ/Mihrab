/**
 * Sync when the app opens — or once an hour, or once a day, or never.
 *
 * ── WHY "ON OPEN" IS THE DEFAULT ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The merge is idempotent and order-independent, so there is nothing to
 * gain from being live and quite a lot to lose: a folder watched
 * continuously means a file provider woken continuously, on battery, for a
 * record that changes five times a day. Opening the app is the moment the
 * user is about to look at their data, which is exactly when it should be
 * current — and it is also the moment they would notice if it were not.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT IS THROTTLED ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `active` does not mean "the user came back to the app". It fires when a
 * share sheet closes, when a permission dialog is dismissed, when the
 * device unlocks with the app in front — several times a minute in normal
 * use. Each round reads a folder, decrypts, merges and writes, so running
 * on every one of those would be a real cost for no new information. Two
 * minutes is far below the rate anyone's data changes and far above the
 * rate the event fires.
 *
 * The other frequencies are the same mechanism with a longer gap, checked
 * against the STORED stamp so that killing the app is not a way to make
 * "once a day" mean "every launch". None of them is a schedule: nothing
 * wakes this app, so a phone left untouched for a week syncs when it is
 * next picked up, whatever is chosen here.
 *
 * A round is skipped entirely, and silently, when there is no folder or no
 * peer. Auto-sync is not the place to nag: the Sync screen says what is
 * missing, and it says it where the user can act on it.

 * Only the timed frequencies need this at all: `open` is answered by the
 * `active` event and `off` by never running. The check itself is a cached
 * read and a subtraction — the round is what costs, and the gap decides
 * whether there is one — and it only runs while the app is in front of
 * someone, so the cost of checking often is close to nothing.
 *
 * Two minutes, which is AUTO_SYNC_MIN_GAP_MS. Nothing can run more often
 * than that floor however fine this is, so it is the finest interval that
 * can ever change an outcome. It was five, which was coarse against an
 * hour and free against a day but a third of the way through the
 * fifteen-minute setting — long enough that "every 15 minutes" would have
 * meant "every 15 to 20".
