/**
 * What to tell the user about a round of sync.
 *
 * The Sync screen and the header button both run a round and both have to
 * say how it went, and they had grown two copies of the same ladder of
 * conditions. One of them was wrong in a way the other was not, which is
 * the usual fate of duplicated logic — so the decision lives here, as a
 * pure function of the outcome and the peer list, and both screens render
 * whatever it returns.
 *
 * ── "SYNCED" IS A CLAIM, AND IT HAS TO BE EARNED ──────────────────────
 *
 * A round that opens a peer's file counts as `read: 1`, and both screens
 * used to call that success. But nothing in the shared folder is ever
 * deleted, so a peer's file is still there — still readable, still
 * mergeable — long after the thing that carries files between the two
 * devices has stopped. The round genuinely reads it, genuinely merges it,
 * and genuinely learns nothing, every two minutes, for ever.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. It is what a Nextcloud folder that quietly
 * stopped syncing looked like from inside the app on 2026-08-26: a Mac
 * reporting "Synced" all day against a snapshot the phone had written the
 * previous afternoon, while four prayers logged on the phone sat in a file
 * that never moved. The app had the evidence — the snapshot says when it
 * was built — and said nothing.
 *
 * So a peer's record now carries its own age (`Peer.dataAt`), and when
 * every dated peer's record is stale the round is reported as the nothing
 * it was, naming the device and the date so the user can tell "my tablet
 * has been in a drawer" from "the folder is broken" — which the app cannot
 * tell apart and should not pretend to.
