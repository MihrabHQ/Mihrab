/**
 * What this device remembers about sync: the folder, what it sends, and
 * when it last ran.
 *
 * ── DEVICE-LOCAL, ALL OF IT ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The folder handle is a Storage Access Framework URI on Android and a
 * security-scoped bookmark on iOS. Both are meaningless on any other
 * device — a bookmark resolved on the wrong phone is at best nothing and
 * at worst somebody else's directory — so this never travels, and
 * `syncCompleteness.test.ts` records that.
 *
 * ── PLAINTEXT, UNLIKE THE IDENTITY AND THE PEER LIST ──────────────────
 *
 * Those two are in the Keystore / Keychain because one is a secret key and
 * the other is a map of someone's devices. This is configuration: which
 * folder, which categories, when it last ran. A secure read that fails
 * would mean sync silently stops, which is a worse outcome than a
 * preference sitting in the same store as every other preference.
 *
 * ── THE SELECTION HAS A DIFFERENT DEFAULT FROM EXPORT ─────────────────
 *
 * Export defaults to everything, because a backup that leaves things out
 * is not a backup. Sync defaults to the RECORD — prayers, fasting, dhikr,
 * sunnah, Quran — and leaves settings and location off, because those two
 * describe a device rather than a person. Nobody wants the adhan volume
 * they set on a tablet at home pushed onto the phone in their pocket, and
 * coordinates are the one category where being wrong is worse than being
 * absent. Both are one toggle away for anyone who does want them.
