/**
 * The snapshot as a file the user can actually hold.
 *
 * A FILE, NOT A MESSAGE BODY. The old shell put the whole backup into
 * `Share.share({message})`, which several targets truncate and most turn
 * into an un-savable blob of text — and a journal with notes runs to
 * hundreds of kilobytes. Writing a real `.json` and sharing its URL means
 * the share sheet offers Files, Drive, and email-as-attachment, and what
 * lands there is the thing this app can read back.
 *
 * No new dependency: `react-native-blob-util` already carries every mushaf
 * page and recitation on disk, and `react-native-share` already ships the
 * month table and the ayah cards. Both are F-Droid-clean and in use.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS AND IS NOT PROTECTED ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The file is plain JSON. It has to be: the at-rest key is bound to the
 * Android Keystore / iOS Keychain and cannot leave the device, so anything
 * this file carried in that form would be unreadable everywhere else. That
 * makes the file exactly as private as wherever the user puts it, and the
 * screen says so rather than implying a protection that is not there.
