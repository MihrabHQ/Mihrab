/**
 * Devices the user has removed, so the removal reaches the others.
 *
 * Forgetting a peer used to be a purely local act, and it did not survive
 * contact with the folder. The removed device's file was still there,
 * still sealed to us, still readable — so the next round opened it and
 * `notePeerSeen` added the device straight back. Removing a device was a
 * button that undid itself within two minutes, and on every OTHER device
 * it did nothing at all.
 *
 * So a removal is now a fact with a date on it, kept here, announced in
 * this device's sealed file, and honoured by whoever reads it.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS SAFE TO LET A PEER REMOVE A PEER ────────────────────────
 *
 * `peers.ts` is emphatic that the peer LIST must never travel: a list that
 * travels makes pairing transitive by accident, and a snapshot that gets
 * exported and shared would silently enrol a stranger's device. Removals
 * are the opposite operation and carry none of that risk — the worst a
 * forged one can do is unpair devices that can be paired again with a
 * code, and it cannot create a pairing that nobody asked for.
 *
 * They still travel only in the SEALED body of a sync envelope, never in
 * an export: `exportFile` builds a plain snapshot, and this rides beside
 * one rather than inside it. A backup someone mails to a friend cannot
 * unpair the friend's phones.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THEY EXPIRE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A removal has to outlive every device's next sync — a tablet switched
 * off for a month must still learn about it when it comes back — and it
 * must not be kept for ever, or the list grows with every device the user
 * ever owned and every file this app writes carries them all. Ninety days
 * is the same answer, for the same reason, as the sunnah tombstones.
