/**
 * The folder, as the app reaches it: one native module, two platforms.
 *
 * `folderSync.ts` takes a folder with three methods and does not care where
 * it came from. This is where it comes from — the Storage Access Framework
 * on Android, a security-scoped bookmark on iOS — and the seam between them
 * is deliberately this narrow, because the interesting half of sync should
 * never have to know which phone it is on.
 *
 * `handle` is opaque here. It is a `content://` tree URI on one platform and
 * base64 bookmark data on the other, and nothing outside the native modules
 * may look inside it.
