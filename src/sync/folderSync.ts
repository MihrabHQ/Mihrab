/**
 * One round of sync through a shared folder.
 *
 * Everything above this is already built and already proved: `snapshot.ts`
 * makes the document, `merge.ts` merges in any order, `envelope.ts` seals it
 * and `peers.ts` says to whom. This is the loop that puts them together, and
 * it is deliberately given a folder rather than finding one — see
 * `SyncFolder` below.
 *
 * ── READ FIRST, THEN WRITE. THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN ───────────────────
 *
 * A round reads every other device's file, merges what it finds, and only
 * then writes its own. That means the file this device leaves behind
 * already contains what it just learned, so a third device that reads only
 * one file still ends up with everything. With the order reversed, a phone
 * that syncs while a tablet is switched off would leave a file missing the
 * tablet's day, and the set would take an extra round to agree.
 *
 * It also means the write goes out to peers learned in the same round: a
 * device that has only just announced itself is a recipient by the time we
 * seal, which is what closes the loop from one code carried one way.
 *
 * ── A DEVICE WITH NO PEERS STILL READS ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It has to. When the user carries A's code to B, B knows A and A knows
 * nothing — so if A refused to read until it had a peer, the pair could
 * never form and the user would have to carry a second code back. Reading
 * is safe with an empty list because an envelope only opens if it was
 * sealed to this device's key, which the sender could only do having been
 * given this device's code. The write is the half that needs recipients,
 * and it is skipped when there are none.
 *
 * ── NOTHING IS DELETED, EVER ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not the other devices' files — they are not ours — and not our own. A
 * device that stops syncing leaves its last file behind, which is a stale
 * record rather than a lost one: reading it again merges the same entries
 * and changes nothing, because the merge is idempotent. Cleaning up would
 * mean deciding when a device is gone rather than merely quiet, and getting
 * that wrong loses data.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES NOT DO ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No locking, no ordering, no retry-until-consistent. The merge is
 * commutative, idempotent and associative, so a half-written file fails to
 * parse and is skipped, a file read twice costs nothing, and two devices
 * writing at once cannot corrupt each other — they write different
 * filenames. This is the whole reason the transport can be a folder that
 * somebody else's software synchronises on its own schedule.

 *
 * The rule above is about a round: it must not decide, on its own, that a
 * quiet device is a gone device, because getting that wrong loses someone's
 * record. That reasoning does not apply to a person tapping Remove. They
 * have made exactly the judgement the algorithm must not make.
 *
 * And leaving the file costs more than untidiness. Nothing rewrites it, so
 * it is frozen — and a frozen snapshot is a device that keeps asserting a
 * day that has since been edited elsewhere. That is not hypothetical: on
 * 2026-08-27 a Mac whose sync identity had been replaced left
 * `mihrab-ASWPFJBG07HZ.sync.json` behind, and it spent a day putting a
 * cleared sunnah back on a phone, several times an hour. `syncWithFolder`
 * now steps over a snapshot it has already merged, which stops the bleeding
 * — but the corpse is still there to be read once by every device that has
 * not met it yet. Removing the device should remove its file.
 *
 * Both names, because a peer leaves two: its snapshot and, until it is
 * acknowledged, an invite addressed to us.
 *
 * Never throws. A folder that will not delete — a read-only provider, a
 * file already gone, an older build with no `remove` — must not turn
 * "forget this device" into an error, because the pairing IS forgotten
 * either way. Returns what it managed, so a screen can say so if it wants.

 *
 * Naming the invite after A fixes that. A knows its OWN id, so it can ask
 * for `mihrab-<A>.invite.json` by name, every round, without enumerating
 * anything. Listing is now needed for nothing at all.

 * ── THE COLLISION, AND WHY IT HEALS ───────────────────────────────────
