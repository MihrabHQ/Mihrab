/**
 * Reading a pairing code off another device's screen.
 *
 * The two platforms do completely different work behind this: iOS decodes
 * QR codes inside the capture pipeline and needs no library at all, while
 * Android drives CameraX and hands frames to ZXing. Neither of those facts
 * belongs anywhere above this file — the caller gets a string or a reason.
 *
 * ── EVERY FAILURE IS NAMED ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Nothing was scanned" covers four situations that need four different
 * things said to the user: they backed out, they refused the camera, the
 * camera was refused earlier and the prompt will not appear again, or the
 * device has no camera. Collapsing them into one message would leave
 * someone tapping a button that silently does nothing.

 *
 * The labels are passed in rather than living in the native side's own
 * resources because the app ships in thirteen languages and the only part
 * that knows which one is running is here. `accent` travels for the same
 * reason: the user picks a colour in Appearance, that choice lives in JS,
 * and a scanner drawn in some other green would be the one screen in the
 * app that ignored it.
 *
 * `#RRGGBB`. Both platforms parse it themselves and fall back to their own
 * green if it is anything else, so a bad string costs a colour rather than
 * a crash.
