/**
 * A portable snapshot of everything the user has actually put into this app.
 *
 * ONE FORMAT FOR TWO FEATURES. Exporting to a file and syncing to another
 * phone are the same problem twice: take the parts of the record the user
 * chose, put them somewhere, merge them into whatever is already on the
 * other side. Building the transfer twice would guarantee the two disagree
 * about what a khatmah plan is, so both go through this module.
 *
 * ── WHY THE CIPHERTEXT CANNOT SIMPLY BE COPIED ────────────────────────
 *
 * The journal, fasting, dhikr and sunnah stores are encrypted at rest with a
 * key that lives in the Android Keystore / iOS Keychain. That key is
 * device-bound and cannot be exported — that is the entire point of it. So a
 * byte copy of the encrypted blob is worthless on any other device, and a
 * snapshot has to carry DECRYPTED values. Confidentiality is therefore the
 * transport's job, not storage's: a file the user saves is as private as
 * where they save it, and a sync link is as private as the channel.
 *
 * ── MERGING IS COMMUTATIVE AND IDEMPOTENT, ON PURPOSE ─────────────────
 *
 * Every rule in `mergeData` is a union, a max, or a newest-wins on a
 * timestamp the writer had already stored. That means:
 *
 *   merge(a, b) == merge(b, a)          — order of devices does not matter
 *   merge(a, a) == a                    — importing twice changes nothing
 *   merge(merge(a,b),c) == merge(a,merge(b,c))
 *
 * Which is what makes a peer-to-peer cycle safe with no server, no agreement
 * about whose clock is right, and no vector clocks: three phones can sync in
 * any order, in any pairing, as often as they like, and land on the same
 * record. It also means a merge can never DELETE anything — the price of
 * that safety, and the right price for a record of someone's worship.
 * Deletions are a separate problem and deliberately out of scope: a bookmark
 * removed on one phone will come back from the other, which is a better
 * failure than a month of prayers vanishing because two devices disagreed
 * about which of them was newer.
