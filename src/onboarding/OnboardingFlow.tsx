/**
 * The first-launch flow: order, transitions, back, and the one write that
 * waits until the end.
 *
 * Each screen owns its question, its controls and its own writes — see
 * `screens/` and docs/design/onboarding-remake.md §3. This file owns only
 * what they share.
 *
 * ── ANSWERS ARE WRITTEN AS THEY ARE MADE ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every screen commits on the tap, not at Start. A flow abandoned on the
 * alerts screen keeps the school chosen before it, and someone who
 * force-quits on the shelf keeps everything up to it. `onboardingComplete`
 * is the single exception, because that flag means "this person has been
 * through the flow", which is the one fact that is not true until they
 * have.
 *
 * ── LEAVING IS A DECISION, NOT A GESTURE ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The route is a modal with no header and no swipe (RootNavigator). The
 * hardware back button steps BACK ONE SCREEN inside the flow rather than
 * dismissing it, and does nothing on the first. That step is worth having
 * precisely because answers are already written: going back to the school
 * screen shows the school the user picked, selected.
