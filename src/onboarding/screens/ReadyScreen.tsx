/**
 * Screen 6 — ready.
 *
 * Not a summary of what was chosen. The user's own day: their city, their
 * times, the prayer that is actually next — and then three links to the
 * things most people change after this, each landing on the page that
 * owns it. The flow ends by handing them the app rather than a door to
 * it. This is what replaces the four-slide feature tour.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT `TodayCard` ITSELF ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The spec asked for the real Home card here, and it is worth recording
 * why it is not, so nobody "fixes" this by pasting a prop bag.
 *
 * `TodayCard` takes `week`, `past`, `nextInfo`, `resetKey` and a dozen
 * more, all assembled inside `HomeScreen` — a memo that filters the
 * optional non-prayer rows by four toggles, injects the Mālikī second
 * times over past-plus-week and splits them apart again, and a watchdog
 * that recomputes the next prayer on a thirty-second tick. A second call
 * site building its own version of that is precisely the disagreement to
 * avoid: two screens deciding which prayer is next, two ways.
 *
 * The honest fix is to lift that assembly into a `useTodayCardProps()`
 * hook that both screens call — and that is a refactor of the most
 * delicate screen in the app, which should not ride along inside an
 * onboarding change. Until it happens, this screen shows the same real
 * times from the same on-device computation the three screens before it
 * used, and `getNextPrayerDisplay` — the very function the Home watchdog
 * calls — decides what is next. What the user sees is their own day.
 * What it is not is a second copy of Home's derivations.
