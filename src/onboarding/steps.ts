/**
 * Which screens first launch shows, in order.
 *
 * ── WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THE SHAPE GOT SMALLER ───────────────────────
 *
 * This used to return four objects carrying an i18n key each — title,
 * body, primary label, secondary label — because every step was the same
 * screen with different words in it: a crescent, a centred paragraph and
 * two stacked buttons. Four steps, one of which contained a decision.
 *
 * The remake gives each step its own component with its own copy, its own
 * controls and its own writes (docs/design/onboarding-remake.md §3), so a
 * shared label bag would be four strings nothing reads. What is left is
 * the only thing this file was ever really for: the ORDER, and which
 * steps apply to this install.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE IS NO LONGER A PLATFORM BRANCH ──────────────────────────
 *
 * `exactAlarms` was a whole screen, on Android 12+ only, whose content
 * was a paragraph about a system dialog. It is now one row on the alerts
 * screen, shown when the OS says the permission is missing and resolved
 * without leaving the flow. So the list is the same six everywhere —
 * minus `location` when the user already has one, which is the single
 * remaining condition.
 *
 * Kept pure, and kept here rather than inlined in the flow component, so
 * a test can hold the order still without rendering anything.
