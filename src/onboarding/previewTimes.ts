/**
 * The times first launch shows the user while they are still deciding.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT `usePrayerDay` ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three screens of the remake show a time as the CONSEQUENCE of a choice
 * the user is making right now: ʿaṣr moving as they pick a school, the
 * day's five times appearing the moment a city lands, Islamic midnight
 * next to the switch that turns it on.
 *
 * `usePrayerDay` cannot answer those. It re-resolves on location change,
 * not on `school` — the school is deliberately absent from its effect's
 * dependency list, because changing it must not re-hit the network — so
 * a madhab screen driven by it would show the same ʿaṣr under all four
 * schools until something else caused a refetch. And its answer arrives
 * asynchronously, which is wrong for a value that has to move under the
 * user's finger.
 *
 * So these are computed on device, synchronously, from the same
 * parameters the app's own offline provider uses.
 *
 * ── WHAT THAT COSTS, STATED PLAINLY ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * When the user's data provider is a published table (Islamiska
 * Förbundet, Habous, the Algerian Ministry) rather than calculation, a preview here can differ
 * from the Home screen by a minute or two. That is acceptable for what
 * these screens are doing and it is worth being precise about why: the
 * madhab screen is a COMPARISON, both sides of which come from this same
 * calculator, so the difference between them — three quarters of an hour,
 * often more — is exact even when each absolute value is a minute off.
 * Nobody is being asked to act on the minute; they are being shown that
 * the choice moves their afternoon.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and synchronous, and none of it writes.
