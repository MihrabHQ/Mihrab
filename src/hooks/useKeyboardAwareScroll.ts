/**
 * A scroll container that keeps the field being typed into visible.
 *
 * ── WHY THE OBVIOUS THINGS DO NOT WORK HERE ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `automaticallyAdjustKeyboardInsets` is an iOS-only prop. It is still
 * set on every scroller that takes this hook, and it does its job there.
 * It does nothing at all on Android.
 *
 * The Android manifest sets `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"`,
 * which looks like it covers the other platform — and it would, except
 * this app draws edge to edge. `SystemThemeModule` calls
 * `WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(window, false)`, and once the
 * decor stops fitting system windows the framework stops resizing for
 * the IME: the keyboard becomes an inset the app is expected to consume
 * itself, and `adjustResize` is dead letter. Verified on a device — the
 * keyboard opened straight over the focused field and the page behind it
 * did not move a pixel. Android's own `ScrollView.onSizeChanged`, which
 * is the thing that normally drags a focused child back into view, never
 * runs either: nothing changed size.
 *
 * ── THE TRAP: TWO COORDINATE SPACES ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious implementation — measure the field with `measureInWindow`,
 * compare it against `keyboardDidShow`'s `screenY`, scroll by the
 * difference — is wrong, and wrong in a way that looks right. Logged off
 * a device, with the keyboard's true top edge at 577.9:
 *
 *     screenY (from the event) ........ 577.9   ← screen coordinates
 *     field, measureInWindow .......... 672.4   ← 51.8 short of screen
 *     scroller frame, measureInWindow .  56.0   ← ditto; really at 107.8
 *
 * `measureInWindow` answers in the root view's space, which sits below
 * the status bar, while the keyboard event answers in the screen's. Mix
 * them and every scroll lands a status bar's height too low — far enough
 * to leave the field under the keyboard, close enough to look like a
 * rounding bug. React Native's own
 * `scrollResponderScrollNativeHandleToKeyboard` mixes exactly these two,
 * which is why it is not used here either.
 *
 * So nothing below compares the two spaces. Everything is worked out
 * inside the SCROLLER's own geometry: where the field sits in the
 * content (`measureLayout`), how tall the viewport is, and how much of
 * it the keyboard covers.
 *
 * ── SO THE HOOK DOES BOTH HALVES ITSELF ───────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. ROOM. Without a resize the scroller still spans the whole screen,
 *     so its last field can never scroll higher than the screen's bottom
 *     edge — which is under the keyboard. `contentPadding` adds the
 *     keyboard's height to the content, so there is somewhere to go.
 *     Android only: on iOS the automatic inset already added it, and
 *     adding it twice leaves a keyboard-sized hole.
 *
 *  2. THE SCROLL. See `scrollFocusedFieldIntoView`.
