/**
 * Palette + isDark hook with belt-and-suspenders Appearance subscription
 * — task #90 follow-up.
 *
 * `useColorScheme()` from RN should fire whenever the system scheme
 * flips, but on Android with `configChanges="uiMode"` and the Material
 * You dynamic palette, some devices (Pixel 8 / 10 in particular) emit
 * the appearance event without invalidating PlatformColor's cached
 * attribute resolution. The result: the user toggles dark mode from
 * the notification panel, the JS scheme updates, but the colorSurface
 * attribute stays resolved against the previous theme.
 *
 * Subscribing manually to `Appearance` here gives us a second wakeup
 * signal independent of `useColorScheme()`. The `bump` counter is
 * included as a useMemo dep so the palette object identity changes on
 * every appearance event, forcing every consumer of the palette
 * (which spreads it into View `style` props) to re-render — and that
 * re-render is what causes RN's ViewManager to re-resolve the
 * PlatformColor attribute references against the now-current theme.
