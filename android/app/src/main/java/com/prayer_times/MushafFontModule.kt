/**
 * Runtime registration of the QPC v2 per-page mushaf fonts — v2.8.0.
 *
 * The mushaf is drawn as text, not as page images: each page has its own
 * font in which one glyph is one word. There are 604 of them and they are
 * downloaded, not bundled, so they cannot be declared at build time the way
 * `assets/fonts` are. Android can load a typeface from any file, and
 * `ReactFontManager` lets us publish it under a `fontFamily` name that a
 * React `<Text>` can then ask for.
 *
 * Family names are *slots* ("MushafSlot0"…), not page numbers: RN caches
 * typefaces by family name forever, so addressing 604 distinct families would
 * pin every visited page's font in memory. JS owns a small LRU of slots and
 * re-registers one when it recycles it; overwriting a slot drops the previous
 * Typeface, and the platform frees the native font once it is unreferenced.
