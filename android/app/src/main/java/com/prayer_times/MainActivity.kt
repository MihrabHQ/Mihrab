  /**
   * `null`, deliberately. Passing the real bundle crashes the app.
   *
   * Android saves the FragmentManager's state into `savedInstanceState`, and
   * react-native-screens puts a `ScreenStackFragment` per screen into that
   * manager. On restore, Android reinstantiates those fragments by
   * reflection — and `ScreenFragment.<init>` deliberately throws
   * `IllegalStateException: Screen fragments should never be restored`,
   * because a restored fragment has no Screen view to attach to and the
   * navigation state is JS's to rebuild, not Android's. The throw comes out
   * of `performLaunchActivity` as a FATAL EXCEPTION before any of our code
   * runs; there is nothing to catch it.
   *
   * Handing `super` a null bundle drops the fragment state, so Android
   * restores nothing and JS rebuilds the stack from its own persisted
   * navigation state, which is where it lives anyway. This is the library's
   * documented requirement (software-mansion/react-native-screens#17) and
   * is in the React Native template — we lost it somewhere and did not
   * notice, because the crash needs the activity to be RECREATED FROM
   * SAVED STATE, which never happens in a debug session:
   *
   *   - the process is killed in the background and the user returns to it
   *     from Recents or the launcher;
   *   - a configuration change outside the manifest's `configChanges` list
   *     — system language, font size, display size — recreates the activity;
   *   - "Don't keep activities" is on in developer options.
   *
   * Observed on a Pixel 10 Pro running 2.10.1 on 2026-08-26: relaunching a
   * live activity took the app down with exactly this stack.

   * 2. React Native's AppearanceModule must emit an "appearanceChanged" event so that

   * and OEM ROMs this value lags behind the newConfig parameter at the moment the call
   * arrives, so AppearanceModule sees no change and never emits the JS event.
