 *
 *   • restartApp()           — fires a fresh launch intent from the
 *     current activity, then System.exit's the process. Used
 *     after the Material You toggle so PlatformColor refs are torn
 *     down and re-resolved against the new theme.
 *
 *   • resolveAccentHex()      — reads `?attr/colorPrimary` from the
 *     current activity theme and returns it as a #RRGGBB string.
 *     SVG icons can't consume PlatformColor; this gives them a hex
 *     that matches the live system accent under Material You.
