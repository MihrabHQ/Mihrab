/**
 * Taps on the Log Today widget, waiting for the app to write them.
 *
 * The journal is an encrypted blob whose key lives on the JS side, so this
 * receiver cannot write it — and should not want to. `logPrayerOnTime` in
 * `prayerLogAction.ts` already owns that write, including the rule that an
 * existing status is never overwritten, and a second implementation of that
 * rule in Kotlin is one that can drift from the first.
 *
 * So a tap lands here, in the same SharedPreferences the payload already
 * uses, and the app drains it through the real writer when it next runs.
 * The widget renders this queue over the payload, so the checkmark appears
 * on the tap rather than on the next launch.
 *
 * THE RULES BELOW MUST MATCH `src/widget/widgetLogQueue.ts`. That file's
 * tests are what say what they are; this is the second implementation of a
 * three-case rule and the only defence against the two disagreeing is that
 * the cases are few enough to state in one place each.
