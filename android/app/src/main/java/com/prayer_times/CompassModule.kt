/**
 * The Android half of the Qibla compass.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * iOS has had a native `CompassModule` since the compass was written:
 * CoreLocation hands over a heading that is already corrected to TRUE
 * north and already fused across the device's sensors. Android had
 * nothing of the kind. It subscribed to `react-native-sensors`'
 * magnetometer and computed
 *
 *     atan2(-x, y)
 *
 * which is a heading only while the phone is lying flat. Tilt it — which
 * is how anyone actually holds a phone they are reading a dial off — and
 * the horizontal components are projections of a vector that is no longer
 * horizontal, so the answer drifts with pitch and roll. It was also
 * MAGNETIC north with no declination applied, which in Morocco is about
 * 1° west, in Sweden about 7° east, and in parts of Alaska over 20°. A
 * Qibla arrow is exactly the case where that matters: the whole point is
 * a direction, and the error is silent.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The approach Kr0oked/Compass takes, which was the reference asked for.
 * Its `MathUtils.calculateAzimuth` and `MainActivity` were read to confirm
 * the sequence and the axis table below match; no code was copied — that
 * project is GPL-3.0 and this one AGPL-3.0-or-later, which are compatible,
 * but the steps here are the platform's own documented recipe rather than
 * anyone's expression of it.
 * https://github.com/Kr0oked/Compass
 *
 *   1. TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR — the fused orientation the platform already
 *      computes from accelerometer, magnetometer and, where present,
 *      gyroscope. Falling back to raw accelerometer + magnetic field only
 *      where no rotation vector exists.
 *   2. getRotationMatrixFromVector, then remapCoordinateSystem for the
 *      CURRENT display rotation — without this the reading is 90° out in
 *      landscape, and this app allows landscape.
 *   3. getOrientation, whose first component is the azimuth from MAGNETIC
 *      north.
 *   4. GeomagneticField for the user's own coordinates, whose declination
 *      is ADDED to the magnetic azimuth to give TRUE north — the same
 *      frame `qiblaBearingFrom` computes the Qibla in. Mixing the two
 *      would put the arrow off by the local declination and look
 *      entirely plausible.
 *
 * One deliberate divergence from the reference: it samples the rotation
 * vector at SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST, which suits an app whose only job is the
 * compass. This one is a prayer app that has already had a compass left
 * running in someone's pocket (docs/design/background-power.md), so it
 * samples at SENSOR_DELAY_GAME — 20 ms, far finer than a dial can show.
 *
 * ── THE CONTRACT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Deliberately identical to the iOS module: a `CompassHeading` event
 * carrying `{ heading, accuracy }`, heading in degrees clockwise from
 * true north, accuracy in degrees with NEGATIVE meaning "do not trust
 * this" — the convention CoreLocation uses and the JS side already
 * branches on. Android reports accuracy as one of four buckets rather
 * than a number, so they are mapped onto representative degree values;
 * the JS scoring reads them the same way it reads CoreLocation's.
