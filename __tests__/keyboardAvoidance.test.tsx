/**
 * Every text field must be reachable while the keyboard is open.
 *
 * ── THE BUG THIS CLOSES ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The app shipped with no keyboard handling at all — not a
 * `KeyboardAvoidingView`, not a listener, not one
 * `automaticallyAdjustKeyboardInsets`. Three things looked like they
 * covered for that and none of them did:
 *
 *  • `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` is in the manifest,
 *    but the app draws edge to edge, and once
 *    `setDecorFitsSystemWindows(window, false)` is called the framework
 *    stops resizing for the IME entirely. Confirmed on a device: the
 *    keyboard opened over the focused field and the page did not move.
 *  • A React Native `Modal` on Android is a Dialog with its own window
 *    and does not inherit the activity's soft-input mode anyway.
 *  • iOS resizes nothing, ever. The keyboard is an overlay.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `automaticallyAdjustKeyboardInsets` is an iOS-only prop, so setting it
 * and stopping is the exact mistake this file exists to catch: it looks
 * like the fix and leaves Android untouched. Anything that sets it must
 * also take `useKeyboardAwareScroll`, which carries the Android half.
 *
 * ── WHY MOST OF THIS IS A SOURCE TEST ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The failure is "the field is under the keyboard", which needs a device
 * with a software keyboard to observe. What CAN be checked here is that
 * every file drawing a `TextInput` participates in one of the
 * mechanisms — the thing that was missing everywhere, and that will be
 * missing again in the next file somebody adds a field to. The hook's
 * own arithmetic is checked for real, below.
