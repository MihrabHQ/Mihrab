/**
 * The two mirrors of the tasbih queue.
 *
 * `widgetTasbihQueue.ts` decides the rules; `WidgetTasbihQueue.kt` and
 * `TasbihWidget.swift` copy them, because the widget process cannot reach
 * the app's store and has to answer "what is the number" on the same frame
 * as the tap. Three copies of a rule is three chances to drift, and a drift
 * here is a bead that the widget counts and the app does not.
 *
 * Runs made that worse, so it is pinned here. A mirror that kept writing a
 * record per bead would still be correct — and still slow, which is the
 * whole point of the change. A mirror that coalesced the wrong action, or
 * replayed a run one bead at a time on every redraw, would be neither.
