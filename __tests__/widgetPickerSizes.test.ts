/**
 * What size each picker entry places, and what its picture promises.
 *
 * The two "tall" entries are not second widgets — they are the same
 * providers under second names, so the picker can show a second preview at
 * a second size (Android renders one preview per provider, at the size
 * `targetCell*` names). They defaulted to 4×3, which is a third of a phone
 * screen, and 4×3 was chosen because 3 rows is where the practice graph
 * appears: GRID_MIN_HEIGHT_DP is 265dp and three launcher rows is ~321dp on
 * a 420dpi phone.
 *
 * They now place 4×2. That is past the thresholds that make them worth a
 * separate entry — the prayer card gets its header and full list at
 * ROWS_MIN_HEIGHT_DP (165dp), the log card its date line and full-height
 * chips past LOG_ROOMY_CONTENT_DP (157dp) — and on an ordinary phone it
 * is past the graph's 265dp too.
 *
 * Which is why the previews are in this test. "Two rows is ~210dp" was
 * measured on a 420dpi emulator and taken for a fact about the widget; on
 * a 1080×2400 phone a launcher row is ~147dp, two rows is ~294dp, and the
 * placed card draws the practice graph. That was reported from a phone
 * against previews that had just had the graph removed on the 210dp
 * arithmetic. So both previews carry the graph — it is what the person
 * choosing this entry gets — and the layouts hand their slack to it, so a
 * grid dense enough to fall short of 265dp shrinks the graph instead of
 * clipping the times above it.
