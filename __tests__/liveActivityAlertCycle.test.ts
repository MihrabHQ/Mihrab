/**
 * The card's action button and the home row are the same control.
 *
 * They were not. The row cycles a prayer through adhan → alert → silent
 * and the card offered "Mute next adhan" — two states, and the only
 * thing it could say was "not the adhan". Someone whose Fajr was already
 * set to the plain alert was offered a mute for an adhan that was never
 * going to play, and someone who wanted silence could not get it from
 * the card at all: the old mute rescheduled onto the plain channel
 * rather than cancelling.
 *
 * So the button became the row. What has to hold for that to be true:
 *
 *   1. the card starts from what the prayer is actually set to;
 *   2. it offers the same modes in the same order, three for a prayer
 *      and two for Sunrise and the night marks;
 *   3. and it stays temporary — one occurrence, addressed by its
 *      instant, and never written back to the standing setting.
 *
 * Two of those are a claim about Kotlin, which has no JVM tests here, so
 * they are read out of the source. That is weaker than running it and it
 * is the reason the constants are stated in one place on each side: what
 * this file can do is refuse to let the two lists drift apart.
