/**
 * What the Today screen is allowed to wait for before it draws.
 *
 * The skeleton on first launch is `usePrayerDay` in `idle`, and it stays
 * up until the hook publishes `ready`. Measured on an emulator — cold
 * start, warm cache, three runs — that took ~915 ms from launch, and
 * 209 ms of it was one cache read the screen does not use: the widget's
 * longer day window (`cachedDaysFrom`), awaited before the state was
 * published. The prayer times were in hand at ~705 ms and the reader was
 * shown grey bars for another fifth of a second so the home-screen widget
 * could have its fortnight. Moving that one read after the publish took
 * the cold start to ~694 ms.
 *
 * ONE read, not two. The days behind (`cachedDaysBefore`) were measured
 * at 1 ms and moving them too broke the Today card outright — see the
 * third test below, which is the one worth reading.
 *
 * The hook is hard to exercise directly — React state, effects, AppState
 * and NetInfo listeners, which is why `usePrayerDay.failover.test.ts`
 * tests the recipe rather than the hook. So what is pinned here is the
 * ORDER, which is the whole property: nothing that the first paint does
 * not need may be awaited before the first paint.
