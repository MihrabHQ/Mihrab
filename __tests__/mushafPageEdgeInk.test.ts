/**
 * The cut that `lineInkPadding` does not reach: the page's OWN top and
 * bottom edge.
 *
 * A line's ink overshoots its box and the line view lets it, by padding
 * the text and pulling the padding back with a negative margin. Inside a
 * page that is free — the room borrowed is the neighbouring line's box,
 * and a line box is transparent. The FIRST line has no neighbour above it
 * and the LAST none below, so they borrow from outside the page, and
 * whatever contains the page clips them there. The landscape column is a
 * ScrollView, and a ScrollView on Android always clips its content.
 *
 * Reported 2026-09-04: in the landscape reader the line at the top of the
 * viewport keeps every letter and loses the marks above it — which reads
 * as a broken font rather than a clip. It shows on every scroll, not only
 * at the top of a page, because the recitation's follow-scroll comes to
 * rest exactly on a line box.
