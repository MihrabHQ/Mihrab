/**
 * What the first launch actually WRITES.
 *
 * Every one of these exists because nothing asserted it and the app was
 * wrong for months.
 *
 * THE BUG. The onboarding notifications step requested the OS permission
 * and then wrote no setting at all. `notificationsEnabled` defaults to
 * false, and `shownAlertMode` opens with `if (!notificationsEnabled)
 * return 'silent'`, so every prayer in the day resolved to silent. A
 * person installed a prayer app, pressed "Enable alerts", granted the
 * permission — and was never notified, with the OS listing Mihrab as a
 * permitted notifier the whole time.
 *
 * There were tests on the onboarding STEP LIST (featureModulesPart2)
 * and on locale parity. Nothing rendered the screen or looked at what it
 * stored, which is the gap this file closes: the asking is now one
 * module, and these pin what its answer is allowed to mean.
