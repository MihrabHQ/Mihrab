/**
 * The mark for a day inside the record that never got filled in.
 *
 * The rule has three edges, and each one is somebody's day:
 *
 *   • Before the first logged prayer there is nothing to be missing. A
 *     graph that opened with two years of marks would be reproaching
 *     someone for the time before they installed the app.
 *   • Today is exempt while it is still being lived — a mark that appears
 *     at Fajr for the Isha you have not prayed yet is nagging.
 *   • A day with four of five accounted for still counts. "Any prayer not
 *     logged" is the ask, not "no prayer logged".
 *
 * The fast is deliberately not part of it: someone who logged a Ramadan two
 * years ago and started logging prayers last week must not find the two
 * years in between marked.
