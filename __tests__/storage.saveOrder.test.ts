/**
 * Settings-write serialization.
 *
 * `updateSettings` fires `saveSettings(next)` on every change. Each save is two
 * async writes (encrypted + plaintext). Two rapid changes — e.g. removing a
 * saved location and then picking a new place — must not land out of order and
 * leave the OLDER snapshot on disk (the user would see their location change
 * "not take" and have to redo it). saveSettings now chains writes through one
 * queue so the most recent state always wins.
