/**
 * The changelog — when it appears, what it says, and in whose language.
 *
 * Two of these tests exist because of cases with no UI at all, which are
 * therefore the easiest to get wrong:
 *
 *   • a FRESH INSTALL, which has just been walked through onboarding and
 *     must not then be handed release notes for a version it has never
 *     not had;
 *   • an install from BEFORE `mihrab.lastSeenVersion` existed, which
 *     looks exactly like a fresh one and must not be mistaken for it, or
 *     the release that introduced this surface can never announce it.
 *
 * The rest pin the table itself. It is generated, so nobody reviews it
 * line by line; a generator that quietly dropped Arabic, or emitted the
 * releases in the wrong order, would ship a plausible-looking file.
