/**
 * Today's quota, in the reader — issue #46.
 *
 * "In addition to the global page indicator (264 / 604 and Juz 14),
 * display today's specific reading progress directly in the reader view
 * so users can monitor their daily target without exiting to the
 * dashboard."
 *
 * The numbers are the dashboard card's own — `khatmahPages` — rather than
 * a second count made in the reader, because two counts of the same day
 * is exactly the shape of #44: two surfaces disagreeing about the same
 * reading, with the reader having no idea which to believe.
