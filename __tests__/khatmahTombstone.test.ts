/**
 * Deleting a khatmah used to undo itself.
 *
 * `mergeKhatmah` unites two devices' plans by id, and a plan that is
 * absent locally and present on the other side is indistinguishable from
 * one the other side has just created — so the next sync round put a
 * deleted plan straight back. The delete was a local act that did not
 * survive contact with the folder, which is word for word the bug
 * `removedPeers.ts` describes for devices and `coerceSunnahLog` for a
 * cleared day. The answer is theirs too: the removal is a fact with a
 * date on it, and it travels.
