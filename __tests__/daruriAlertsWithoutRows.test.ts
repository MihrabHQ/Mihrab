/**
 * Being told about a boundary without having to draw it — issue #19.
 *
 * The reporter asked for the notifications and specifically not the rows:
 * *"Having an additional time in the rows will just make the UI compact
 * and bad looking."* The app could not give him that. One switch,
 * `malikiSecondTimesEnabled`, decided both — the card's rows AND whether
 * the alert list was passed to the scheduler — so the only way to be told
 * about a boundary was to also put it on the card.
 *
 * The wiring underneath it matters as much as the switch: the schedule
 * reads the boundaries out of the WEEK it is handed, so a week built
 * without them cannot produce an alert however the settings read. That is
 * why the injection now follows the feature and the drawing follows its
 * own setting, and why HomeScreen passes `alertWeek` rather than the week
 * it draws from.
