/**
 * CHANGING YOUR MIND ABOUT A KHATMAH THAT IS ALREADY UNDER WAY.
 *
 * There are two plans in this app — "in thirty days", which waits for the
 * reader, and "by the 30th", which re-cuts what is left every morning —
 * and until now the choice was made once, at the start, and could only be
 * unmade by deleting the khatmah and starting again. These are about the
 * switch: in both directions, at any point, with the reading kept.
 *
 * Three things have to hold for that to be safe, and they are the three
 * things tested here:
 *
 *   • the reading survives — progress, holes, and where the reader is
 *     standing are not the pacing's business;
 *   • the plan asks for what was actually agreed — a length is solved for
 *     from where the reader IS (`khatmahDurationForDaysLeft`), and the
 *     schedule a plan is judged against starts at the decision, not at
 *     the plan's birthday;
 *   • two devices cannot end up on half a decision each.
