/**
 * The practice graph fills the card it is drawn on, and reads in order.
 *
 * Reported with a screenshot: on a 4x4 the graph stopped about eighty
 * pixels short of the right-hand edge that the divider, the date and the
 * "0 of 5 logged" line all reach — which reads as a graph being clipped,
 * not as a graph that chose to be narrower.
 *
 * The cause was an estimate. The column count came from a cell size
 * derived from the box's HEIGHT — a number the caller can only guess at,
 * since it is the launcher's report for the host view less whatever chrome
 * the card thinks it draws — and the cell was then drawn at a different
 * size again. Two shapes with no reason to agree, and when they disagreed
 * `fitStart` scaled the bitmap to whichever axis bound first and left the
 * remainder against one edge.
 *
 * It is answered from the WIDTH now, which the caller does know: the
 * columns are however many readable cells fit across it and the cell is
 * that width divided exactly among them. The height only decides how many
 * rows there is room for, rounded down, because a row too few is a band of
 * empty card and a row too many is the whole graph shrunk away from its
 * edge.
