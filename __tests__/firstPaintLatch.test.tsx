/**
 * The boot-time bookkeeping waits for the first frame, and nothing else
 * changes about it.
 *
 * A cold start measured 87 ms between the Today card's first ready
 * commit and the next animation frame, with the JS thread spent on the
 * alert schedule, two reminder sets, the widget payload and the Live
 * Activity — none of it visible, all of it in the frame the reader was
 * waiting for. `src/boot/firstPaint.ts` is the latch that moves it one
 * frame later. These pin the latch's contract and who is behind it.
