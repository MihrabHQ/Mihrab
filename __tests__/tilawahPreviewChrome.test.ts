/**
 * Two things the Tilāwah page was missing, both invisible from the code
 * that draws them.
 *
 *  1. The word highlight. The preview renders the same surface the reader
 *     does, so it gets the ayah's wash for free — but the WORD inside it
 *     is published by a probe, and only the two readers mounted one. The
 *     page looked right and nothing inside it moved, which is exactly
 *     what "the highlight doesn't work here" looks like.
 *
 *  2. A way back. The page is the transport and then a hundred and
 *     fourteen rows under it, so finding a surah leaves you a long way
 *     from the controls you started at.
