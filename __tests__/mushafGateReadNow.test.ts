 * The reader opens the moment the download starts.

 * Nobody read anything until all 180 MB had landed: the gate held a
 * progress bar in front of the muṣḥaf for as long as six hundred files
 * took. A page needs only its own font, the surface fetches that on
 * demand, and the pages either side are warmed ahead — so once the
 * download has been asked for, the reader opens and carries a strip.
