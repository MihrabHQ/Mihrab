/**
 * A page read is a page done — the set, the window, and the mark.
 *
 * Progress used to be a high-water mark, which could only say how far.
 * It had to count pages nobody read when a reader skipped forward, and it
 * had nowhere to put today's portion read out of order. These pin the
 * replacement: which pages are done, what may be credited right now, and
 * that a plan written before any of this still behaves exactly as it did.
