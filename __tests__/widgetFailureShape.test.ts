/**
 * What a prayer widget does when something goes wrong — issue #31.
 *
 * The report is a Huawei Nova 11i on 2.17.1 showing "Could not load
 * widget data" on the two widgets this provider draws, while the five
 * that do not use it were fine, and remove-and-re-add not helping. The
 * cause is on that phone and cannot be reproduced here, which is the
 * whole point of this file: the SHAPE of the failure was wrong in three
 * ways that can be fixed without owning the device.
 *
 *  1. The reason was discarded. `catch (_: Exception)` threw away the
 *     one piece of information that existed, in the one process that
 *     had it, and left a user and a maintainer looking at a sentence
 *     with no cause attached.
 *  2. An extra could take the times down. Everything after the six times
 *     — the night line, the streak, the practice grid — shared one
 *     try/catch with them, so any throw in a decoration replaced a
 *     perfectly good prayer card with an error.
 *  3. `Calendar.getInstance()` follows the default locale. On Thai and
 *     Japanese locales that is not a Gregorian year, and the payload's
 *     dateKey always is, so no day would ever match.
 *
 * Plus the tap, reported in the same issue and confirmed by reading the
 * code rather than by reproducing it: the root of these two widgets was
 * a bare MainActivity intent, which is what "opens the app wherever I
 * was before" means.
