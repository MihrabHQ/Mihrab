/**
 * Which language the app opens in.
 *
 * The rule has two halves and the interesting one is the second:
 *
 *   • Nobody has chosen → follow the phone, every launch. Someone who
 *     switches their device to Arabic should not have to find the picker.
 *   • Somebody has chosen → their choice, forever. A phone that changes
 *     language must not move an app that was told what to speak.
 *
 * The migration is what makes this safe on an install that predates the
 * flag. Before it, the picker and the default wrote the same field, so a
 * stored 'en' could mean either "I chose English" or "nobody ever asked" —
 * and every install that never touched the picker had exactly that. Any
 * OTHER stored language can only have come from the picker, so it counts
 * as chosen. That is the difference between fixing an Arabic phone stuck
 * in English and throwing away the French someone picked on purpose.
