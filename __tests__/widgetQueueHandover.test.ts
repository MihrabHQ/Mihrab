/**
 * Handing a widget queue over is not the moment to redraw the widget.
 *
 * Both interactive widgets — Log Today and Tasbih — work the same way: a tap
 * cannot reach the app's storage from a widget process, so it is appended to
 * a queue and the widget draws the queue PROJECTED over the last payload.
 * That projection is what makes the number move under a thumb.
 *
 * A tap therefore lives in exactly one of two places, and there is a window
 * between them:
 *
 *   1. `take` clears the queue and hands the entries to JS
 *   2. the app applies them to its store          (a promise, not yet resolved)
 *   3. the app republishes the payload            (later, and debounced)
 *
 * Between 1 and 3 the tap is in neither: gone from the queue the widget
 * projects, absent from the payload it projects onto. Both `take` methods
 * used to call `requestUpdate` right after clearing — reasoning that the app
 * now owned the taps, which is not true until 3 — and so drew that empty
 * window on screen.
 *
 * On the Tasbih widget that is the whole of a reported bug: press +, the
 * count goes up (projection), snaps back down (this redraw), then up again
 * when the payload lands. On a counter just started that snap-back is
 * literally zero, and after Next it is the previous dhikr's count.
 *
 * The redraw was never needed either: step 3 ends in `setData`, which fans
 * `requestUpdate` out to every widget kind, so the correct redraw already
 * happens at the only moment it is correct.
