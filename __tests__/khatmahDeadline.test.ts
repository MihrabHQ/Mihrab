/**
 * "FINISH BY THE 30th" — the second way to pace a khatmah (issue #53).
 *
 * A duration plan is cut once and its day number is the reader's. A
 * deadline plan is cut every morning out of what is left, and its day
 * number is the calendar's. These hold the second one: the quota that
 * grows when a day is missed, the day that does not recede as it is read,
 * the date that has already gone by, and — the whole reason this mode
 * exists — "days left" meaning days, not portions.
