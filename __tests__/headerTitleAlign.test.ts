/**
 * Where a title sits, decided rather than inherited.
 *
 * React Navigation centres a header title on iOS and leads it on Android.
 * The app had never chosen, so the same screen — Notifications, Quran,
 * Duas — read as two different designs depending on which phone it was
 * opened on. Both navigators now say what they want.
 *
 * The one exception is Today, and it is an exception with a reason: that
 * row is a wordmark beside a location chip, not the name of a pushed
 * screen, and a centred title reserves the middle third of the bar and
 * left the city name running off the right edge. It says so itself.
