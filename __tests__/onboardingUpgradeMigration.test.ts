/**
 * An existing user is not a new user.
 *
 * `locationOnboardingComplete` has had an absent-key migration since it was
 * added — no key means an install that predates the flag, which means
 * somebody already using the app, so it loads as true and they are not
 * asked for their city again.
 *
 * `onboardingComplete` never got the same treatment. So an install whose
 * blob predates THAT flag loaded it as false and was routed into the
 * new-user welcome on update: the salam, the notifications ask, the
 * exact-alarms ask, and then the feature tour. Existing users were being
 * shown the greeting as an accidental release note, which is not a thing
 * anyone chose — see docs/design/onboarding-plan.md §2.4.
 *
 * The risk in fixing it is the opposite mistake, and it is worse: a
 * migration that fires on a genuinely fresh install would mean onboarding
 * NEVER shows, for anybody, ever. The last test here is the one that
 * matters.
