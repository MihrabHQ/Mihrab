/**
 * The macOS half of release verification, pinned.
 *
 * `build-catalyst.sh` proves the widget will have data by deleting the App
 * Group payload, launching the app, and requiring it back with today's
 * date. On 2026-09-13 that gate failed the 2.19.0 release on an app that
 * was fine: it launches hidden (`open -g -j`), and a hidden scene never
 * becomes foreground-active, so the screen that writes the payload never
 * runs its data effect. On a Mac somebody is using, it resolves anyway. On
 * one whose display has gone to sleep, it does not.
 *
 * Measured that day on the SHIPPED 2.18.5 from /Applications, so the build
 * could not be blamed: hidden, nothing after ninety seconds; visible,
 * today's payload in under ten.
 *
 * So the shape below is the fix, and the reason it is a test rather than a
 * comment: the hidden launch stays the default, because a build should not
 * throw a window onto whatever you are doing — but it can no longer be the
 * only evidence a release is rejected on.
