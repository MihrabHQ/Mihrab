/**
 * THE KHATMAH OPTIONS DIALOG, DRAWN THROUGH THE CLOCK.
 *
 * Reported with a screenshot: "Khatmah options" printed across the status
 * bar, over the time and the camera. The card is absolutely positioned,
 * and it had no vertical anchor — when the anchor moved out of `menuCard`
 * into `menuCardResting` so the keyboard-lifted dialogs could take one or
 * the other, the two dialogs with a text field were given it and this one
 * was not. An absolute box with no `top` sits at the top of its window.
