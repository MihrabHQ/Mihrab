/**
 * What is actually inside each translation asset — issue #37.
 *
 * `translationLoader.test.ts` already checks that every registered
 * edition has a FILE. That is not the same as having a translation.
 * `es.garcia` was assembled here from GitHub mirrors rather than
 * downloaded whole from Tanzil (tanzil.net is not reachable from this
 * environment — docs/data-sources.md records the whole chain), and the
 * failure mode of assembling a corpus by hand is not a missing file. It
 * is a file that parses, loads, opens fine on Al-Fatiha, and is missing
 * the last forty ayahs of Al-Baqarah.
 *
 * So this reads every edition the app ships and demands the whole
 * Qur'an of it, shaped like the Qur'an: 114 surahs, 6,236 ayahs, the
 * right number in each surah, and no blanks.
