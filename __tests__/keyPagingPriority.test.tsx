/**
 * Who holds the arrow keys, and when.
 *
 * On Mac the letters turned pages and the arrows did nothing: a scroll
 * view scrolls itself with ← and →, that is system behaviour, and system
 * behaviour beats a key command declared at the end of the responder
 * chain. Taking the arrows back is `wantsPriorityOverSystemBehavior` —
 * but a command that outranks the system also outranks a focused text
 * field, where the arrows move a caret. So the claim has to be released
 * whenever anything is being typed into, and these tests hold that.

 *
 * Reported on the Mac: the arrows stopped turning pages. A blur is the
 * only event that hands the claim back, and unmounting a focused
 * `TextInput` does not fire one — so the surah search released the arrows
 * and never took them back, twice over: it is rendered only on the Surah
 * tab, so Juz or Marks removes it mid-focus, and the whole sidebar goes
 * on the way into fullscreen. The letters went on working, which is the
 * signature of the claim being down rather than the binding being gone.
