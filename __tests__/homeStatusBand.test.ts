/**
 * The strip behind the status bar on the phone's Today screen.
 *
 * The sky runs up under the clock and the battery, which is the design.
 * But the page scrolls, and the hero's own top row — the city, the Qibla
 * bearing — rode up into that strip and was drawn straight through the
 * system's glyphs (reported on a Pixel 10 Pro at 2.18.1). So the strip
 * stops being clear the moment anything would pass behind it.
 *
 * A band of some colour of its own would read as a slab laid over the
 * sky, so it wears the sky: the exact colour of the pixel under its own
 * foot, which is why the join cannot be seen. These are the sums that
 * make that true.
