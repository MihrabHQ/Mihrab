/**
 * The Log widget has to know what time it is.
 *
 * Reported on iOS, macOS and Android at once, which was the clue: the
 * adhan passes, and the prayer it belongs to is not offered for logging
 * until the app is opened. No chip to tap, the footer still naming the
 * prayer that has already been called, the countdown still counting to a
 * moment in the past.
 *
 * One cause, three symptoms. `buildTodayBlock` stamps a `due` boolean into
 * the payload — `at <= now` at the instant the app writes it — and every
 * renderer read that flag as though it tracked the clock. It cannot: the
 * payload is written when the app is open, and the whole point of a widget
 * is the hours when it is not.
 *
 * Both platforms were ALREADY waking up correctly. Android arms an alarm
 * at each prayer boundary and fans a redraw out to every provider; iOS
 * emits a timeline entry at each remaining prayer time. Both then redrew
 * the identical frozen boolean, which is why the wake-ups were invisible
 * and the bug looked like "the widget never refreshes".
 *
 * So the fix is not more refreshing. It is that the renderer decides
 * dueness itself, from the row's `HH:mm` against the clock at the moment
 * it is drawing — with the payload's flag kept only as the fallback for a
 * row whose time will not parse, or a block that is not about today.
