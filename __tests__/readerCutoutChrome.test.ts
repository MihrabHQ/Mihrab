 * 59pt strip of page colour carried a black pill in the middle of it, and
 * the page header row — a surah name at one end, a tone pill at the other —
 * sat below that. The island is in the MIDDLE; the row's two ends never
 * wanted those points.
 *
 * LANDSCAPE: the cutout moves to one end of the long edge, straight over
 * the ayah sheet's text and controls.
