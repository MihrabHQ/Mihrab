/**
 * WHAT THE READER TOOK AWAY HAS TO TRAVEL (reported 2026-09-20).
 *
 * "Progressing a khitma is dragged back by its old point when syncing
 * between two devices, which is also the reason that a removed khatmah
 * marker comes back on sync." Two symptoms, one shape — and this repo has
 * now met that shape five times: the peer that un-removed itself
 * (`removedPeers.ts`), the cleared sunnah day, the abandoned khatmah plan,
 * the un-marked page, and these.
 *
 * A union and a max can only ever say MORE. An absence says nothing at
 * all, so the device that still has the row wins by default and the
 * removal undoes itself on the next round. Everything below is the same
 * answer applied to the places that still lacked it: the removal is a
 * fact with a date on it, and the merge reads dates.
