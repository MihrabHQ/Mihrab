/**
 * The height budgets the Android cards size themselves against.
 *
 * These exist because of a bug that survived three rounds of "fix the
 * clipping": the prayer-times strip and the Log Today card both drew their
 * full-height variant into a card too short to hold it, and the last row —
 * the next-prayer line on one, the countdown footer on the other — came out
 * as a few points of clipped text.
 *
 * The cause was not the layouts. `widget_card_inset` gave every widget a 6dp
 * gutter on all four sides in August, a week after the height constants were
 * measured; the constants describe the CARD and the launcher reports the HOST
 * VIEW, so from that commit on every budget was 12dp too generous. That is
 * invisible until a launcher row happens to land in the gap it opens — one
 * row on a 480dpi phone is ~147dp, which is exactly there — and then it is a
 * clipped line that no amount of staring at the XML explains.
 *
 * Two invariants, then, and they are what this file pins:
 *
 *  1. Every budget is host-view relative, so it carries the inset twice over
 *     on top of the card content measured from a real `dumpsys` hierarchy.
 *  2. The budget that CHOOSES a variant is the budget the slack is measured
 *     against. The old code picked the layout on one number (145) and filled
 *     it from another (132), and the difference went into padding that
 *     pushed the footer off the bottom.

 * everything that is left. Measured on a 432dp host: the ImageView got 233dp
 * and the arithmetic asked for 178, so a graph built for two thirds of its
 * box was centred in it and the missing third became the void, split above
