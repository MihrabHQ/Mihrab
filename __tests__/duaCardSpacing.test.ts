/**
 * The gap that a centred column swallowed.
 *
 * Every one of these pages is a ScrollView whose `contentContainerStyle`
 * carries `gap` — which separates the ScrollView's DIRECT children. That
 * worked until `CenteredColumn` was wrapped around the cards to give
 * iPad and Mac a reading measure: from then on there was exactly ONE
 * direct child, the gap separated nothing, and the cards sat flush
 * against each other. It looks like a design choice rather than a bug,
 * which is why it survived on five screens after LogScreen hit it and
 * was fixed on its own.
 *
 * The rule this file pins: if a screen's scroll content is a
 * CenteredColumn, the spacing between its cards belongs to the column —
 * passed as BOTH `style` and `innerStyle`, because CenteredColumn is a
 * plain pass-through on a phone and only grows its inner capped column
 * on a wider window, so a gap on one of the two is right half the time.
