/**
 * Choosing a school — issues #21 and #22.
 *
 * The app asked one madhab-shaped question, the Ḥanafī ʿaṣr shadow, and
 * hung everything else that varies by school off its own toggle beside
 * it — so a Ḥanafī ʿaṣr and a Mālikī second time could be chosen together
 * and then had to be explained in red.
 *
 * What these pin is the promise that made the change safe to make: NO
 * EXISTING INSTALL MOVES. A school is a thing you go and pick; until you
 * do, the settings you had are the settings you have, to the minute.
