/**
 * A countdown that reaches zero has to be met by a refresh.
 *
 * Reported as "the countdown to the next prayer can be wrong before Fajr",
 * which is the one window where two separate holes lined up.
 *
 * The DISPLAY has wrapped past midnight for a while: after Isha there is no
 * row left today, so every card counts down to tomorrow's first prayer
 * instead of showing nothing. Good. But `nextBoundaryMillis` — the thing
 * that decides when to wake up next — did not wrap. It looked only at
 * today's rows, found nothing ahead, and returned null, so no boundary
 * alarm was armed at all between Isha and midnight.
 *
 * And the alarm it does arm was `setExact(RTC, …)`. `RTC` does not wake the
 * device, and Doze defers even an exact alarm. Fajr is the hour a phone is
 * most reliably asleep, so the boundary that most needed to land was the
 * one that could not.
 *
 * Together: the card counted down to Fajr, hit zero, kept going, and went
 * on naming a prayer that had already been called until somebody picked the
 * phone up. Both halves are pinned here, because either one alone leaves
 * the bug.
