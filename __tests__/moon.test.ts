/**
 * The moon in the hero: what phase it is, and which way up.
 *
 * ── WHAT WENT WRONG BEFORE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The old model was a straight line — a new moon in 2000 plus whole mean
 * synodic months — and the only test on it checked three dates in
 * January 2024. All three passed. The model was still out by up to 23
 * hours of lunar age and drew the wrong one of the eight phases on one
 * night in ten, because three spot dates cannot see a drift that comes
 * and goes over a month.
 *
 * So these check the SHAPE of the answer as well as its value: that the
 * month is the length it really is and varies the way it really varies,
 * that the crescent turns over between hemispheres, and that it lies on
 * its back on the equator. Those are things a broken model fails and a
 * lucky date cannot rescue.
