/**
 * Which portion of a khatmah the reader is in.
 *
 * The rule under test is one sentence — the current portion is the one
 * holding the next unread ayah — and everything the feature promises has
 * to fall out of it without a second mechanism:
 *
 *   • finishing the day makes tomorrow's reading available immediately;
 *   • stopping partway into a later portion makes THAT one current;
 *   • finishing a portion read ahead makes the one after it current;
 *   • the day still reads as done afterwards, with the rest as extra.
 *
 * The failure this guards against is the reader opening the app and being
 * shown somewhere other than where they stopped, which is the one thing
 * this feature must never do.
