/**
 * The muṣḥaf is the reader; the verse-by-verse list is a setting.
 *
 * Opening a surah has landed on the muṣḥaf since v2.7.27, but the other
 * reader was always one tap away in the header — so the app still
 * shipped two answers to "what does the Qur'an look like" and asked
 * everybody to pick. It is one answer now, and
 * `settings.quranVerseByVerseEnabled` (Settings → Quran) is how somebody
 * asks for the second.
 *
 * Two things have to hold, and they pull in opposite directions.
 *
 * The muṣḥaf must win by DERIVING, never by writing: if turning the
 * setting off rewrote `quranReadingMode` to 'mushaf', the reader someone
 * had been using would be forgotten the moment they looked away, and
 * turning the setting back on would drop them somewhere they did not
 * leave. So the pref is read past, not overwritten.
 *
 * And nobody who was actually USING the list should lose it to an
 * update. That is the migration, and its condition is narrower than it
 * looks — see the storage tests at the bottom.
