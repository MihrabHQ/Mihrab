/**
 * How big is this, before I say yes.
 *
 * The listening page offers to put a reciter's whole Quran on the phone.
 * That is somewhere between a third of a gigabyte and a gigabyte and a
 * half depending on whose voice it is, and the difference is not a detail
 * — it is the whole of the decision the person is making.
 *
 * Nothing in the catalog carries a duration or a size, but every EveryAyah
 * folder ends in its bitrate, so the estimate is read rather than guessed.
 * What it is NOT is a promise: the hours are an average across reciters
 * who differ by a factor of two, which is why every string built on this
 * says "about".
