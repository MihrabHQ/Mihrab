/**
 * In a widget, `Text("literal")` is a filesystem read.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-30 against the shipped 2.13.6 build. Launching the app
 * to force one refresh made the extension burn 10.46s of CPU in thirteen
 * seconds, against 0.00s over ten seconds idle. WidgetKit kills an
 * extension that holds 80% for twenty, so one ordinary refresh already sat
 * four fifths of the way to being killed — and a button press, which is
 * just another render, finished it. That is the blank widget, and repeated,
 * the widget that disappears. Five CPU-kill reports on the developer's Mac,
 * spanning 2.10.1 to 2.13.6, every one the same stack.
 *
 * `sample` on the extension mid-burn put 4004 of 4262 samples here:
 *
 *   renderUntilStable → AccessibilityNodeAttachment.init
 *     → AccessibilityText.init → Text.resolveAttributedString
 *       → LocalizedStringKey.resolve
 *         → -[NSBundle localizedAttributedStringForKey:value:table:localization:]
 *           → _copyStringTable → _loadStringsFromData → parse 13 KB of plist
 *
 * The `localization:` on that selector is the whole story. Every widget
 * sets `.environment(\.locale, mihrabLocale())` so labels follow Mihrab's
 * language and not the system's — correct, and the reason the setting
 * exists. But a locale that differs from the bundle's own takes SwiftUI off
 * NSBundle's cached lookup and onto the localization-qualified one, which
 * re-reads and re-parses the .strings file. Per label, per render pass, and
 * again for every accessibility label.
 *
 * So the extension resolves its own strings now and hands SwiftUI a String
 * it cannot look anything up in. These tests exist because the fix is one
 * character away from being undone: `Text("k")` and `widgetText("k")` read
 * the same at a glance, and the cost of the difference is invisible until a
 * user's widgets start vanishing.
