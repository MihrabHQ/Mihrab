/**
 * Sunrise is not a prayer, and must never be given the adhan.
 *
 * Reported live: "the sunrise now plays adhan". The scheduler has had the
 * rule for a long time — NON_PRAYER_EVENTS, `isNonPrayer`, the plain
 * default sound — but nothing ever ran it. The tests in this area check
 * `resolveSoundTargets` in isolation, which is the one piece that was
 * never wrong, so the rule was one bad `if` away from disappearing without
 * a single failure.
 *
 * This drives the real `syncPrayerNotifications` and reads back what each
 * event was actually handed: the Android channel, the iOS sound, and the
 * `usesAdhan` / `adhanSound` pair the in-app player keys off. Three doors,
 * because the adhan can reach a notification through any of them and
 * closing one is not closing the others.
