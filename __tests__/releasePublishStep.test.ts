/**
 * The publish phase — the part that cannot be rehearsed.
 *
 * Every other phase of release.sh can be run with --dry-run. This one
 * only ever runs for real, against a live tag, so its bugs are found in
 * the worst possible place. These tests are the rehearsal it cannot have.
 *
 * They exist because the first review of that phase found a live one:
 * `gh release create file#Label` sets a display LABEL, not the asset
 * name. The asset keeps the file's basename, so uploading gradle's output
 * directly would have published `app-fdroid-release.apk` — and every
 * download URL in existence would 404: the one in the release notes, the
 * one verify-release.sh checks, and the one F-Droid's recipe resolves.
 * The manual 2.13.0 release got this right only because the APK was
 * copied to its published name first.
