# IFiS prayer-times dataset builder

Scrapes the Islamiska Förbundet **bönetider** widget once, server-side, and
publishes a static dataset the app reads instead of scraping the flaky origin on
every device. This is the durable replacement for the live per-request scrape.

## What it produces

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data/prayer-times/v1/cities/<slug>.json` | Full rolling window per city (served via GitHub raw / CDN, fetched + cached at runtime) |
| `data/prayer-times/v1/index.json` | Coverage summary + city list |
| `src/providers/data/ifisSeed.json` | Compact near-term seed **bundled into the app** for offline / first-launch |

The app reads these in `src/providers/islamiskaForbundetDataset.ts`, which is the
primary Sweden source in `fetchPrayerTimes.ts`. Lookup order on device:
**cached CDN mirror → bundled seed → live widget scrape → AlAdhan → local adhan.**
So even total pipeline death only degrades to the existing fallbacks.

## How it runs

`.github/workflows/ifis-dataset.yml` runs it **every Monday** and on manual
dispatch, commits any changes to `main`, and **emails `mihrab@elghamri.se` on
failure** (origin down, data going stale, or push failing).

Run locally: `npx tsx tools/ifis-dataset/build.ts`

### Behaviour

- **Incremental** — keeps existing days, fetches only missing ones up to the
  horizon. Steady-state ≈ one request per city per new day (~760/week).
- **Date-major** — covers near-term dates for *all* cities first, so a budget
  cap still yields full near-term coverage everywhere.
- **Gentle** — 300 ms between requests, bounded retries.
- **Alarms (non-zero exit → email):**
  - exit 2 — origin unhealthy (≥20 requests, >50 % failed).
  - exit 3 — least-covered city below the freshness floor (default 14 days).

### Env knobs (workflow inputs mirror these)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `IFIS_HORIZON_DAYS` | 400 | how far ahead to cover |
| `IFIS_MAX_REQUESTS` | 8000 | per-run request budget |
| `IFIS_MAX_WALL_MIN` | 50 | per-run wall-clock budget |
| `IFIS_SEED_DAYS` | 60 | bundled-seed window |
| `IFIS_FRESHNESS_MIN_DAYS` | 14 | min near-term coverage before alerting |
| `IFIS_REQUEST_DELAY_MS` | 300 | politeness delay |

## First-time setup

1. **Add the email secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
   `MAIL_SERVER`, `MAIL_PORT` (465 SSL / 587 STARTTLS), `MAIL_USERNAME`,
   `MAIL_PASSWORD`. Without them the job still runs; only the email step is
   skipped.
2. **Backfill** — from the Actions tab, run *"IFiS prayer-times dataset"*
   manually. One 50-minute run covers ~90 days for all 109 cities (near-term
   first); run it 2–3 times, or let the weekly schedule extend coverage toward
   the full horizon. The bundled seed refreshes on `main` each run and reaches
   users on the next app release; the CDN files reach users immediately.

## Maintenance

The parser is shared with the app (`src/providers/islamiskaForbundetParser.ts`)
and owned by the `provider-doctor` subagent. If the bönetider HTML changes, the
job fails the freshness/health gate and emails — fix the parser, add a fixture
under `__tests__/fixtures/islamiskaForbundet/`, and re-run.

## Rows that are not the day they claim to be

Asked for a date in a year it has not published, the widget answers with
the same date of the current year. Most days that is within a minute of
the truth; between the two years' clock changes it is an hour off. The
builder checks every row — fetched now or kept from before — against
solar noon (`src/prayer/tableDayCheck.ts`): Dhuhr is noon plus four to
six minutes on every true row, so a Dhuhr an hour from noon is refused
and the day is left out (the phone computes it). The log lists the
rejected days. Each stored day also carries the date it was last read
(`fetched`, ignored by phones), and days read `IFIS_REFRESH_AFTER_DAYS`
(90) ago or more are read again as the budget allows, nearest first, so
a late-published year replaces the copy served meanwhile.
