/**
 * Build the Moroccan prayer-times dataset from the ministry's own pages.
 *
 * Per-city JSON committed to the repo, an index the app polls, and a
 * bundled seed so a fresh install works before it has downloaded anything.
 *
 * ── NO DATE PARAMETER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A source that answers a query for A GIVEN DATE lets a builder walk a
 * 400-day horizon. The ministry has no such parameter: `index.php`
 * takes a `ville` and nothing else, and returns whatever HIJRI MONTH it is
 * currently showing. One request buys about thirty days and you cannot ask
 * for the thirty after them.
 *
 * So coverage is built by ACCUMULATION. Each run merges the month it sees
 * into what is already committed and drops days that have gone stale. Run
 * weekly, the window grows for a few months and then holds; between runs
 * the forward horizon dips to roughly three weeks at worst, which the
 * computed fallback covers — and since the Morocco calculation now sits
 * within a minute of the ministry, that fallback is not a cliff.
 *
 * ── THE ORIGIN IS FLAKY, AND THAT IS DESIGNED FOR ─────────────────────
 *
 * Probing habous.gov.ma five times produced two TLS failures, a connection
 * reset and a connect timeout before a success. A build that treated any of
 * those as data would commit a hole. So: retries per city, an origin-health
 * gate that abandons the whole run rather than committing a partial one,
 * and a coverage floor below which the run fails loudly instead of quietly
 * shipping a thinner dataset than yesterday's.

 * The gate is STALENESS, not horizon — and that distinction is the whole

 *
 * The forward window is capped by something we do not control: the ministry
 * publishes one Hijri month and offers no way to ask for another. Probed
 * exhaustively — `mois`, `month`, `m`, `mois_hijri`, `hijri`, `shahr`, `mm`,
 * `annee`, on the query string and through the page's POST form, plus
 * horaire_hijri.php and horaire_hijri_fr.php — every one returns the current
 * month. So coverage runs from about 29 days just after a month turns down
 * to nearly nothing just before, and no amount of building changes that.
 *
 * A gate that failed on a short horizon would therefore fire every single
 * month, for a condition nobody can fix, and would be muted within two.
 * That is precisely how five red releases went unread earlier in this
 * project's life.
 *
 * What IS controllable is whether the data is current. Every city should
 * hold TODAY. A city that does not is a real hole — a failed fetch that
 * never recovered — and that is worth failing over.
